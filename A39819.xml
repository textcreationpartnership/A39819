            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Learned Author of this Book gives ſeveral Inſtances of his Ingenuity and Candor. He recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends ſome</hi> Primitive Practices that juſtifie our Reformation; <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the continual reading and ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the</hi> Holy Scriptures. <hi>Speaking of the Ancient Chriſtians, he ſays, that</hi> they ſtudied the Word of God in private, Meditating upon it Day and Night. They read over in their Houſes what they heard at the Church. Maſters of Families took care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat thoſe Expoſitions of Scripture they had Learnt from their Paſtors.</p>
            <p>Many <hi>Lay-Chriſtians</hi> could ſay the
<pb facs="tcp:57456:3"/> Holy Scripture by heart. They gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally carried a Bible about with them; and many Saints have been found Buried with the Goſpel lying on their Breaſts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Women,</hi> no leſs than Men, read the Holy Scripture; and in the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion regretted nothing ſo much as the loſs of their Bibles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parents</hi> took ſuch care to Inſtruct their Families, that in all Antiquity we find no <hi>Catechiſm</hi> for little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, nor any publick proviſion made for the Inſtruction of thoſe that were Baptized before they came to Years of Diſcretion. Every private Houſe was then as a Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He obſerves that St.</hi> John <hi>was the</hi> Chief <hi>in our Saviour's Affection;</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt had a particular Kindneſs for his Diſciples, and for his Apoſtles; and among them for St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the two Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> and for St, <hi>John</hi> above all the reſt.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57456:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>He does not found the Preference of the</hi> Bleſſed Virgin, <hi>upon Blood and natural Relation; but upon the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Qualifications of her Mind. Notwithſtanding the moſt tender Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST had for his Mother,</hi> He ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to have expreſſed himſelf harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards her; and reproved the Woman that Bleſſed her barely upon the account of her being his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and declared that he owned no other for his Mother and Kindred, but they that did the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He knew what that great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was able to bear, and was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let the World ſee, that Fleſh and Blood had no ſhare in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> Fleury <hi>well obſerves,</hi> that the Church of Jeruſalem which JESUS CHRIST, with his own Hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Build upon the Foundaion
<pb facs="tcp:57456:4"/> of the Synagogue was <hi>the Root and original of all other Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He ſeems in nothing more to cenſure the Reformation, than in what he writes of the</hi> Celibacy of Prieſts; <hi>altho'</hi> Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina <hi>a Contemporary with</hi> Aeneas Sylvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us <hi>tels us that, that Learned Pope</hi> Pius II. <hi>uſed to ſay;</hi> 'There was great reaſon for Prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſts to Marry, but greater for allowing it again. <hi>And Mr.</hi> Fleury <hi>writes thus of the Primitve Chriſtians;</hi> they knew but two States, <hi>Marriage</hi> or <hi>Continence.</hi> They generally made chocie of the Married State, having no good opinion of the Celibacy of the Heathen; tho' they preferred the State of Continence as knowing its Excellency, and often found a way of Reconciling both theſe States into One; for there were many Married Perſons, who yet Lived in Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. They conſidered Marriage as an Emblem of that Union, which
<pb facs="tcp:57456:4"/> is between Chriſt and his Church. They knew that the Relation of Father and Mother, was an High and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable Character, as being the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of God, in a more peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and co-operating with him in the Production of Men. It is Certain by the Goſpel, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was a Married Man. Tradition tells us the ſame of St. <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle; and that both of them had Children; and it is particularly obſerved that St. <hi>Philip</hi> gave his Daughters in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Among the Rules they give for the Education of Children this is one, that to ſecure their Virtue, they ſhould timely diſpoſe of them in Marriage: And they adviſed thoſe that out of Charity Bred up Orphans, to match them as ſoon as they came to Age; and that to their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren rather than to Strangers; ſo little did they regard Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What He ſays of their</hi> Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<pb facs="tcp:57456:5"/> in both Kinds; <hi>publickly Reading the Holy Scripture always in the</hi> Vulgar Tongue: <hi>The Cuſtom of Sitting in their Churches; the Length of their Sunday-Service, is alſo Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. When they</hi> reſerved part of the Sacrament <hi>as a Viaticum for Dying Perſons, that which they carried Abroad, was only the Bread;</hi> tho' in their publick Aſſemblies, all in general Communicated under both Kinds; excepting little Children, to whom they gave only the Wine.</p>
            <p>All the Leſſons of the Scripture were Read in the <hi>Vulgar Tongue; i. e.</hi> in the Language Spoken by the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort of People in every Country.</p>
            <p>During the time of the Leſſons and Sermon, the Audience was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Seated, the Men on one ſide of the Church, and the Women on the other: When all the Seats were filled the younger ſort of People continued Standing. In <hi>Africa</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57456:5"/> takes notice that the People ſtood all Sermon-time; but he better approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cuſtom of the <hi>Tranſmarine</hi> Churches, as he calls them, where they heard Sitting.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Litnrgy</hi> muſt needs have been very long: Indeed Chriſtians did not then think that they had any thing elſe to do on Sundays, but to ſerve God. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to ſhew how much his Strength was decayed, ſays, that he was ſcarce able to keep himſelf ſtanding for thoſe Three Hours, while he performed the Office of the Church; and yet his Sermons that are left us, are very ſhort</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What Mr.</hi> Fleury <hi>ſays of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, the Church had for</hi> Hereticks <hi>muſt not be omitted, becauſe nothing ſeems more to have encreaſed the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Diviſions of Chriſtendom, than ſeverity.</hi> The Church Interceeded in behalf of her own Enemies. We have many Epiſtles of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57456:6"/> where he Begs the favour of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in the behalf of the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> convicted of horrid violencies, and even Murders committed on the Catholicks. He pleaded that it would be a diſhonour to the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Murdered, to put to Death the Authors of them, and that if they could find no other penalties for them but Death, they would thereby bring themſelves to that paſs, that the Church who delighted not in the Blood of her Adverſaries, would not dare to demand Juſtice againſt them. This was a general Rule, that the Church ſhould never ſeek the Death of any Man. They were content that Chriſtian Magiſtrates ſhould Correct or over-aw Hereticks, by Baniſhment or Pecuniary penalties, but they would have their Lives Spared: And the whole Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt the proceeding of the Biſhop <hi>Ithacius</hi> who Proſecuted the
<pb facs="tcp:57456:6"/> Arch Heretick <hi>Priſcillian</hi> to Death. Yet the Biſhops could not always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Pardon they deſired for theſe ſort of Offenders, no more than they could for others. Princes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the publick Peace, Enacted the penalty of Death againſt Hereticks, and their Laws were ſometimes put in Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If in theſe latter Ages the</hi> Vows <hi>of Celibacy, and Poverty have been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and but ill kept; this might have been prevented by the Omiſſion of of them; for as this Author obſerves;</hi> We ſee no Solemn Vows in theſe firſt times. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks of a Monks returning to the World as of a thing altogether free.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again He tells us that</hi> the <hi>Monks,</hi> in imitation of the Primitive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, ſpent much of their time in Reading the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> The Rule of St. <hi>Benedict</hi> preſcribes the ſame to his Monks; and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:57456:7"/> that all the time of Lent, and on Sundays, they ſhould apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only to this Exerciſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He Judiciouſly remarks how</hi> Forged Books <hi>and</hi> pretended Miracles <hi>gained Credit:</hi> For want of critical Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the knowledg of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they were ready to receive ſuch Suppoſitious Writings as were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the World, under the ſpecious Names of Eccleſiaſtical Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and alſo became too Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in believing Miracles. So cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it was that the Apoſtles and their Diſciples had wrought Miracles, and that many true one's were Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed at the Tombs of the Martyrs, that they were not now over-curious in examining ſo as to diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe. The moſt ſurpriſing Relations of this kind in Hiſtory, were the beſt receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Ignorance in Philoſophy, and the little knowledg they had of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:57456:7"/> made them take all ſtrange Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances for Prodigies and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them as the Supernatural ſigns of God's wrath. They believed there was ſomething extraordinary in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trology, and dreaded Ecclipſes and Comets as diſmal Preſages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To give but one Example more;</hi> Religion, ſays Mr. <hi>Fleury,</hi> can't ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without Study and Preaching to preſerve the Soundneſs of its Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and the Purity of its morals. It muſt neceſſarily fall into Decay, unleſs the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Read, taught, and expounded to the People; unleſs the <hi>Apoſtolical Traditions</hi> be preſerved in their Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Purged from time to time of thoſe <hi>Spurious Additions,</hi> which the Inventions of Men, without any juſt Authority have made to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Would but the Church of Rome take away theſe and all other Additions, that are contrary to and Inconſiſtent with</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57456:8"/> 
               <hi>the Doctrine and Practice of the Church of Chriſt, in the firſt and pureſt Ages of Chriſtianity, and forbid all Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as</hi> Innocent XI. <hi>by his Decree of the</hi> 19. <hi>of</hi> Feb. 1678. <hi>entirely abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed the Office of the Immaculate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Approved by</hi> Paul V. <hi>They might happily put an end to the great Diviſion that has ſo long made the Enemies of Chriſtianity to rejoyce; or, be able to maintain the charge of Schiſm againſt thoſe that ſhould then refuſe their Communion.</hi>

               <p>I Shall divide my Work into four Parts: The firſt will repreſent the Manners <note place="margin">I.</note> of the Chriſtians of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the <note place="margin">The divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the whole.</note> Deſtruction of that City, under <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> This firſt ſtate of Chriſtianity, though but of a ſhort continuance, was ſo ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent in its Perfection, that it will deſerves a ſeparate Conſideration.</p>
               <p>The ſecond will take in all the Time of the Perſecution; that is the entire ſpace of three Centuries.</p>
               <p>In the third I ſhall deſcribe the State of the Church in its Liberty, which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced in the fourth Age. And</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57456:10"/>
               <p>In the laſt conſider the Changes it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards underwent; and endeavour to diſcover the Cauſes of them.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Religion, as it was not the Invention of Man, but the Work of <note place="margin">II.</note> God; ſo like the Univerſe, it had its full <note place="margin">The firſt part, the Church of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</note> Perfection in its firſt Birth, and was moſt Glorious in its earlieſt Productions. It is not to be imagined, ſaith <hi>Tertullian, that the Apoſtles were ignorant of any Truth, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to Salvation, or that the Invention of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tertul. <hi>Praeſcript.</hi> C. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>after Ages hath found out any new Rule of Living more perfect, or more Sublime than what Jeſus Chriſt taught his Diſciples.</hi> But this Heavenly Doctrine did not always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the like effects, but had its different Operations according to the different Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of thoſe that received it, or the different meaſures of Grace, with which God was pleaſed to Accompany it. The true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who had by the Tradition of their Fathers, and the uſe of the Holy Scriptures, been bred up in the knowlege of the true God, and from their Infancy inured to the obſervation of his Laws; the Goſpel found them well prepared for that higher Perfection it required, when that perfection ſhould be diſcovered unto them, and they ſhould be made to underſtand, what kind of Salvation that was, which their <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to bring them, and what kind of Kingdom, his Kingdom was to be.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57456:10"/> But as for the Gentiles, who had hitherto <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12</note> lived without God, and without Law, trained up (according to the cuſtom of the then Deluded World) in the moſt horrid <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2</note> Superſtitions; Worſhiping (with as little underſtanding as the Beaſts of their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice) dumb Idols, plunged in ſenſuality, and habituated to all ſorts of Impieties and Impurities, it was far more difficult for them to Riſe to the ſame Perfection. So that 'tis among the Chriſtians of this firſt Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we muſt look for an Example of a Life, the moſt perfectly Chriſtian, and conſequently the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happy, that Mortality is capable of.</p>
               <p>We muſt <hi>begin</hi> with the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt himſelf,</hi> who is both the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the Model of all perfection. He <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jo.</hi> 13. 15.</note> hath given us an Example that as he hath done, ſo ſhould we do. And this is one of the grand Advantages we receive by the Incarnation, that thereby the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſenſible, and by converſing with Man, as Man rendred himſelf the Object, not only of our Admiration and Adoration, but of our Imitation alſo; having in his Life ſet us that perfect Exemplar, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to which, we are to Regulate ours. I know very well, that a Life ſo Divine cannot he worthily deſcribed, but by thoſe <hi>who have ſeen with their Eyes and heard with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>their Ears, and whoſe hands have handled the</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57456:11"/> 
                  <hi>Word of Life, and who were themſelves acted by his Spirit.</hi> Yet may every Man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaſure of his Capacity, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his thoughts and meditations upon it, and point out ſome of the particulars which he Judges more proper for our Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; leaving it to others more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the exerciſes of Devotion and the practice of Chriſtian Vertues to make ſtill farther Diſcoveries in ſo Inexhauſtible a Subject.</p>
               <p>In the Life of Jeſus Chriſt we cannot go too far back. He was an Example from the Cradle, and in his firſt Years ſet us a Copy of the firſt Vertues we are capable of Learning, that is, the Vertues of Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. He ſhewed himſelf in that Age Docile, Tractable and Submiſſive towards his Parents, and of ſuch a ſweetneſs of Temper and Behaviour, that rendred him amiable in the ſight of all that beheld him. For thus ſaith the Scripture; As he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 40. 52.</note> in Stature, ſo he increaſed in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in favour with God and Man. As for all the reſt of his Youth till he came to be thirty Years of Age; we have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account of it, but that he abode in the little City of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> paſſing there <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 3. 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> for the Son of a Carpenter, and was a Carpenter himſelf. This Silence of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 3.</note> expreſſes better than any Words could have done, the State of Privacy in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57456:11"/> which as yet he lived. Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (He who came to be the light of the World) paſſed the greateſt part of his Days upon earth in obſcurity. He ſpent thirty years in the condition of a private Life, and only three or four in Preaching, and the publick exerciſe of his Miniſtry, to ſhew that 'tis the duty of the generality of men to keep themſelves within a private Station, and labour in ſilence, and that 'tis only for ſome few perſons to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon publick Functions, and that only ſo far forth as they ſhall be by the Deſignation of God, or by Charity toward their Neighbour, obliged thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Occupation which he choſe to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is alſo worthy our Reflexion. To live by the labour of ones Hands, is a ſtate of Life more Poor, than to have Lands to Till or Cattle to Feed. Whether his Trade of a Carpenter was to build Houſes, or (as ancient Tradition reports) to make <note place="margin">Juſtin <hi>in</hi> Tryph.</note> Plows and other Inſtruments of Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry; 'tis certain 'twas a mean and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious employment: but at the ſame time a very uſeful and neceſſary one to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and ſuch without which there would ſcarce be any living in the World; and therefore a more laudable way of getting a lively-hood than any of thoſe that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter only to Pleaſure and Vanity. Thus he paſſed his younger days in the Family
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57456:12"/> of his Father, and place of his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leading a life not ſlaviſh or reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nor trifling and inſignificant; but ſerious, employed, and laborious, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Penalty impoſed upon the Poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> of earning their Bread with the ſweat of their Brows, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf an Example of thoſe two Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues he ſo much recommended to others, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ma.</hi> 11. 27</note> 
                  <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before he ent'red upon the execution of his Miſſion, he prepared himſelf for it by Baptiſm, Prayer and Faſting; not that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 21.</note> he had any need of theſe Preparatories, but that he might (as he himſelf expreſſes it) fulfil all Righteouſneſs, and give us an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15.</note> His Faſt of forty Days and forty Nights, and ſubſiſting ſo long without Food, is ordinarily look'd upon as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, as well as the like in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> But I know not whether we do in this matter ſufficiently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſtrength of Nature it ſelf. St. <hi>Simeon Stylites</hi> did more than once paſs <note place="margin">Theodor. <hi>Hiſt. Relig. P.</hi>
                  </note> an whole <hi>Lent</hi> together without Eating, having by degrees brought himſelf to ſo prodigious an Abſtinence. And at this Day there are Idolaters in <hi>India,</hi> who can paſs twenty days or more, without taſting a bit all that while.</p>
               <p>During this Faſt, and all his long abode in the hideous ſolitude of the Wilderneſs;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57456:12"/> in what can we imagine he employ'd his Time but in Prayer? But who dares pretend to deſcribe the Praying of Jeſus Chriſt? Let us humbly Meditate upon what the Scripture hath left to us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; and more eſpecially upon that Heavenly Prayer, recorded by St. <hi>John:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.</note> Nay, let not the Manner after which he prayed, nor the Circumſtances, of it eſcape our Obſervation. He prayed in the darkneſs of the Night, and ſometimes whole Nights together. He Prayed in Publick, and he Prayed in Private; in the Garden, in the Mountains, in the Wilderneſs, removed out of the noiſe of the World, where no mortal Eye could ſee him. He lift up his Eyes and his Hands to Heaven, he caſt himſelf upon his bended Knees; He proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated his Body on the Earth; teſtifying by all this his profound Veneration and Submiſſion to his Heavenly Father.</p>
               <p>He ſuffered himſelf to be tempted, to animate us after his Example, couragiouſly to reſiſt the evil one. He repelled every aſſault by Scripture inſtances, to teach us among other things, to be always Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating upon theſe ſacred Writings, to have recourſe to them upon all occaſions, and to regulate every Action according to their Directions.</p>
               <p>After that he takes upon him his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and makes his Publick Appearance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57456:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the World; beginning from that time to lead a Life which is the Model, after which Prieſts, Biſhops, and all publick Perſons ought to form theirs. His princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal employment was the Inſtruction of Mankind, and the Converſion of Sinners. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 10.</note> He came (as he himſelf declares) to ſeek, and to ſave that which was loſt. To that end, by the Miraculous Cure of Diſeaſes, and his many other Works, he drew the Eyes of all the World upon him; thus at the ſame time convincing their Judgments by the Proof of his Power, and gaining their Affections by inſtances of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For Miracles as they were neceſſary eſtabliſh his Miſſion, ſo were they of no leſs Efficacy to recommend his Doctrine: And 'tis in this, that the holy Biſhops of old, tho' without the gift of Miracles, knew how to imitate their Maſter; they knew what weight their Works would add to their Doctrine; and therefore by the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Alms, the Protection of the Oppreſſed, the Reconciliation of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and other ſuch like good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they did to Mankind, endeavoured to recommend themſelves to the World, and gain Reſpect and Love to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; though even the Works themſelves of Jeſus Chriſt; as to the manner of them, are not altogether above our imitation, for they may ſerve to teach us the Vertues of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57456:13"/> Simplicity, Humility, and Patience. He did his Miracles without Affection, without any thing of Oſtentation or Vain-Glory, and without ſo much as being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, unleſs ſometimes when he found it neceſſary, either to exerciſe the Faith of thoſe who wanted his help, or to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, and make it the more Exemplary to others. He generally concealed his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Performances, with as much care as others do their diſgraces. He ſeems to attribute them rather to the Faith of the Patients, than to his own Power. And this is given as the reaſon, why he did ſo few of them at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> becauſe of their <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 6.</note> unbelief, at which 'tis ſaid, he himſelf mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled. He aſcribed all to the Glory of his Father, <hi>I can of mine own ſelf do nothing,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 30.</note> ſaith he, <hi>my Father that dwelleth in me, it is</hi>

               </p>
               <p>He muſt needs have had a wonderful Patience to endure that incredible mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and the greateſt part of them Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſed, Poor and miſerable Creatures, that continually crouded after him, and preſſed with that violence to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of him, that they even threw themſelves upon him, as appears when he healed the Woman who laboured under <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. 24. <hi>Mar.</hi> 3. 9.</note> the Iſſue of Blood; and when he bad his Diſciples provide a ſmall Ship to wait on him, to ſave himſelf from the Throng.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57456:14"/> When he was in any Houſe, all the City <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 33. and 3. 20.</note> crowded to the Doors, as it were beſieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and not giving him time to eat; ſo that he could not ſo much as enter into the Cities but by ſtealth, and was fain to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 45.</note> abide without in the deſart places; and yet even there the People in vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes flocked after him; as appears by the five thouſand Men he fed in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that he was forced to retire to the Mountains for Prayer, to ſpend whole Nights there, and ſleep only at broken intervals, paſſing from place to place; as appears by his ſound ſleep in the Ship, when in the midſt of a tempeſt at Sea. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>His Life was far more painful now, than it was when he lived by the Labours of his Hands; for now it appears he had none of his former leiſure, by his permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Women to follow after him to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 2</note> ſupply him with Neceſſaries, and by his keeping ſome mony by him, of which <note place="margin">

He is obſerved to have given Alms; and yet at the ſame time he wanted himſelf; ſo that he was forced upon working a Miracle, to pay for himſelf and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the Tribute of the <hi>firſt born,</hi> which was but half a Shekel, that is of our Coin about fifteen Pence.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57456:14"/>
               <p>And indeed, he always lived in great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. He ſaith himſelf, That he had not <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Ma.</hi> 10. 45.</note> place to place on Foot; and when he made his entrance into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> riding upon an Aſs; it is plain that was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Action. He travelled in the heat of the Day. When he met the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> tis ſaid, that was about the ſixth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 6.</note> Hour, that is, about Noon, and that he reſted himſelf by the Well, being wearied with his Journy: For though he was the Lord of Nature; yet we do not find that ever he wrought a Miracle for his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Benefit, or to ſave himſelf any Labour. 'Tis once ſaid, that the Angels came and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 11.</note> Miniſtred to him, to ſhew the right he had to command them, had he been pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have made uſe of it.</p>
               <p>In this ſame inſtance of his meeting with the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> we ſee his wonderful Modeſty, for 'tis ſaid, That <hi>his Diſciples marvelled that he talked with a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Woman.</hi> And his very Enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had never the Face to invent any Calumny againſt him that could call his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57456:15"/> Chaſtity into Queſtion. Nor was this a forced Modeſty? There was nothing ſtreined nor Affected in him, who was the declared enemy of Hypocriſy, and who was the very Truth it ſelf. His Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſimple, eaſy, Natural; yet live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Affecting. He obſerved the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances of People, as when 'tis ſaid that he beheld the Rich young Man, and lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, Cheriſhing with a Compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate look the very firſt beginnings of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in him, how weak and Imperfect ſo ever they were. He is often obſerved to have Stretched forth his Hands, and uſed other ſuch like expreſſive Geſtures. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by his Looks, and by his Words, He diſcovered the Sentiments of Admiration, Indignation, Anger, and of that uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the unbelief of Men put him to. At other times again, he Expreſſed the ſofteſt Affections of Tenderneſs and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; as when he cauſed the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be brought unto him; laid his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 9. 46. <hi>and</hi> 10. 14.</note> Hands upon them, Embraced them in his Arms, and Recommended to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples the Imitation of their Innocency and Humility.</p>
               <p>As to his outward Appearance, there was nothing ſingular or Extraordinary in it. He conformed himſelf to the ſame way of Living with the other <hi>Jews,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as a private Perſon, and had no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57456:15"/> External Marks to Diſtinguiſh him from the Common People; one of whom he makes himſelf, by the name of the Son of Man; for that's the meaning of that Appellation. He led a Life full of Hardſhip and very Laborious, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſingular Auſterity. He Fed as others did, he abſtained not from Wine, nor made any Scruple of being ſeen at great Entertainments; as at the Marriage in <hi>Cana,</hi> and at St. <hi>Matthews</hi>'s Feaſt. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 29.</note> And yet he ſo little regarded Eating, that his Diſciples once putting him in mind taking ſome Food; when he had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly occaſion enough for it, his anſwer was, I <hi>have other Meat to Eat that ye</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 32. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>know not of: My Meat is to do the will of my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet notwithſtanding this mean and ſimple outward Appearance, he maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Marvellous Dignity, and kept him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf far above Contempt. His Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was always ſerious, Grave and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Upon two Several occaſions it is taken Notice of him that he Wept; but not at all that he Laughed; nay or ever ſo <note place="margin">
                     <hi>In Matt. Hom.</hi> 6. <hi>Mar.</hi>
                  </note> much as Smiled, at leaſt, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerves. He never asked any Man a Farthen, choſeing rather to Work a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle than be beholden to any Body for a piece of Mony, to pay his Tribute with. But when he ſent his Diſciples to ſeek an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57456:16"/> Aſs to make his Entrance into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and to take up for him an upper Room where he might keep the Paſſover; he ſhews by his manner of Speaking that he well knew no Man could have denied him any thing he ſhould have asked. He proved his own ſaying by his Actions. <hi>That it is more bleſſed to Give than to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act</hi> 20. 35.</note> ſince continually diſpencing ſo many benefits to others he received ſo little from them. All the World ſought to him and ran after him, and he ſought to no Man; but going from City to City, Exhorted all Men every where to Repentance. He was free of Acceſs to all Perſons that were any way Diſeaſed, and to all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners whom he found diſpoſed for Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. To theſe laſt ſort he ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo eaſy and Familar as even to Eat with them, and Lodge in their Houſes. So that upon this occaſion he ſuffered a certain <hi>Woman to kiſs his Feet and Anoint</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>them with Ointment;</hi> a ſort of Indulgence, which might otherwiſe have ſeemed very oppoſite to that Poverty and Mortification he always Profeſſed.</p>
               <p>As he came into the World for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all Mankind, he was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon his Work of Teaching both in Publick and Private. On the Sabbath Days, he uſed (according to the cuſtom of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 16.</note> the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors) to Expound the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57456:16"/> in their Synagogues; and thence they gave him the Title of Maſter or <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi.</hi> But he had a peculiar Air of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed him from their Doctors. <hi>He taught them</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>as one having Authority,</hi> ſaith the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, and <hi>they wondered at the Gracious</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Words which proceeded out of his Mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His diſcourſe was plain and clear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Ornament than thoſe lively and natural Figures, which are never wanting to a man fully perſwaded and affected within himſelf, and which are therefore the moſt powerful to perſwade and affect others. He ſpake much in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and ſometimes anſwered Queſtions put to him, more by his Actions than by his Words, as when he ſaith to the Diſciples of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, Go and ſhew</hi> John <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>again thoſe things which you do hear and ſee.</hi> He lays down great Principles without ſhewing himſelf much concerned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate them, or to draw any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from them. Theſe Principles carry in themſelves ſuch a light of Truth, that if any Man withſtand them, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is wilfully Blind. And 'twas to puniſh this Depravity of their Hearts, that ſometimes he ſpake to them in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables and dark ſayings. If at any time he made uſe of Proofs and Arguments, they were generally ſimple and natural,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57456:17"/> taken from ſenſible Objects and Familiar Compariſons. His Miracles and his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues were of all others the moſt Powerful Proofs, and which he moſt inſiſted on, as being adapted to all ſorts of Capacities, and therefore far more Convincing than all the Syllogiſms of Philoſophers. The learned, as <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and the unlearned as the <hi>Man</hi> that was <hi>born blind,</hi> were equally affected with this way of Proof. To this he often joins the Teſtimonies of the Law and the Prophets, demonſtrating that his Doctrine proceeded from the ſame Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his Miracles from the ſame Power, and that the Old and New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are both founded upon the ſame Divine Authority. 'Tis to this purpoſe, he ſo often makes uſe of the writings of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 31.</note> the Old-Teſtament, either by expreſs Quotations of the very Letter of it, or by manifeſt Alluſions to it.</p>
               <p>'Twas in this Spirit of Submiſſion to Divine Authority, that he Nurtured up his Diſciples; afar different method from what the Philoſophers took with theirs; who under the pretence of ſeeking after the Truth, encouraged nothing more in their Pupils than a Spirit of Diſputation and Contention. But Jeſus Chriſt came not to ſeek the Truth, but to diſcover it, in ſuch meaſure as he (who had the full poſſeſſion of all Truth, or rather who was
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57456:17"/> himſelf the very Truth it ſelf) ſhould think fit: To the intent that they might the more profit, both by his diſcourſes and by his Example; he ſeldom ſuffered them to be long out of his Sight, living in common with them, and making of <note place="margin">Tertul. <hi>de praeſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They accompanied him whether ſoever he went, they eat and lodged together with him; ſo that they had the opportunity of being conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually taught by him and learning every Moment. He inured them to the imitation of his Poverty, ſending them abroad with out furniſhing them either with money or any other ſorts of Proviſions; nay, and when he kept them with him, hunger ſometimes forced them to take up with what they could meet with in the Fields; as when they plucked the Ears of Corn on the Sabbath-Day.</p>
               <p>He took great care to Inſtruct them; <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Jo.</hi> 15. 15.</note> whatſoever he had learned of the Father; that is, ſo far as they were Able to bear it. And yet he did not fondly humour them in their vain Curioſity: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we ſometimes find him expreſſly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primanding them for their bold Enquiries, both before and after his Reſurrection;

               <p>By his Diſciples, I here underſtand thoſe Twelve he had choſen to be always with him. But the Scripture gives the name <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 29.</note> as our Neighbour, whom we ought to Love as our ſelves; as indeed he himſelf laid down his Life for all Men: Yet he had a more particular Kindneſs for his Diſciples, and amongſt them for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and amongſt them for St. <hi>Peter</hi> and the two Brothers the Sons of <hi>Zebedee;</hi> and for St. <hi>John</hi> above all the Reſt. I ſhall nor here enquire into the Reaſons of this Diſtinction, or why St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> ſhould have received ſuch eſpecial Marks of his Favour?

               <p>Who can doubt but that he had a moſt tender Affection for his Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57456:20"/> eſpecially if we conſider the care he took of her when he was Dying? And yet he ſeems ſome times to have expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf ſomewhat Harſhly towards her: As when ſhe found him <hi>Diſputing in the midſt of the Doctors,</hi> and when at <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 49.</note> the Marriage-Feaſt ſhe told him that their Wine failed them.

                     <hi>Ma.</hi> 14. 14.</note> that forced him at two Several times to multiply the Loaves of Bread; 'twas this his Compaſſion that forced him to raiſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 13.</note> from the Dead the Son of the Widow of <hi>Naim.</hi> He was a true Lover of his Country, and deeply concerned for the Welfare of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> In the midſt of his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph

He taught Men their Duty of Obedience to their Prince, Reverence to the Prieſts and Doctors of the Law how corrupt ſoever they might be; and he himſelf paid an Exact Obſervance to the Laws and Ceremonies of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though at the ſame time he was come to put an end to thoſe Ceremonies, being Maſter both of the Sabbath and of all the Laws. Yet would he never <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 8.</note> take upon him to exerciſe any Authority as to Civil affairs, no not ſo much as to Arbitrate a Difference between two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 14.</note> Being Interrogated by Authority, he ſeverally anſwered his Judges accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what Properly fell under their Cogniſance. To the High Prieſt, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his profeſſing himſelf Chriſt and the Son of God; and to <hi>Pilate,</hi> concerning the Title of a King. He declared that his Kingdom was not of this World, and conſequently that his Doctrine threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no danger to the Publick, but as to Civil Government left all things as it found them. It would be too Preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Undertaking to pretend to diſplay all his Vertues and Excellencies. 'Tis a ſubject in which thought could never come to an end, and thoſe Pious Souls
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57456:21"/> who apply themſelves to a cloſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Meditation upon the Goſpel, do ſtill diſcover freſh Wonders in it. Let me juſt add a Word or two concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Paſſion, where as the example was ſingularly Great and Extraordinary, ſo are we nearly concerned in the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues it teaches; the Vertues of knowing how to bear Sufferings; a Tryal we can ſcarce live in the World and Eſcape.</p>
               <p>The Sorrowful Eſtate into which Jeſus Chriſt was reduced in the Garden of <hi>Olives,</hi> Sufficiently proves that he was Subject to the like Natural Paſſions of Fear and Grief with other Men, and that therefore 'twas not Inſenſibility but Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that carryed him through his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. He bore them all with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Conſtancy, without making any Defence, without Reſiſting, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſubmit to whatſoever his Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters laid upon him: Immovable as a Rock he received all their Scourgings and Outrages. His Silence was ſuch as made his Perſecutors themſelves admire. He who with a Word Speaking could have confounded his Accuſers, the falſe Witneſſes, and his Judges themſelves; yet he opened not his Mouth, and that becauſe he knew they were not diſpoſed to hear any thing in his Juſtification. Upon the Croſs it ſelf, and under the laſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57456:21"/> Agonies of his Suffering, he ſtill Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the ſame firmneſs of mind, the ſame Freedome, nay the ſame Tranquillity of Spirit. He Prayed for them that put him to Death; he recompenced the Faith of the good Thief; he took care to provide for his diſconſolate Mother; he fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the Prophecies; he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Spirit to God.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles after their having receiv'd the Holy Ghoſt appeared in the World as ſo many Living Images of Jeſus Chriſt, and as it were Tranſcripts of that Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, according to which the Faithful were to form themſelves. Nor do they ſtick to declare as much. <hi>Be ye followers of me ſaith St.</hi> Paul <hi>even as I am of Chriſt,</hi>

               <p>So that though they diligently applyed themſelves to Teaching, they did it more by their Examples than by their Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Among the Faithful the Apoſtles choſe out ſome ſelect Perſons whom they made their Diſciples, and upon whom they beſtowed more full and diſtinct Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, uſing them as they themſelves had been uſed by Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe their Diſciples in particular, always attended their Perſons, living in the ſame Houſe with them, Eating at the ſame Table,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57456:22"/> and Lodging in the ſame Room: At leaſt tis after this manner, that the Author of the Recognitions deſcribes St. <hi>Peter</hi> to have Lived with his Diſciples. Nor is this Tradition (as will afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) lightly to be rejected. Theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples accompanied the Apoſtles in their Travels, and as new Churches were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed had the Government of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into their Hands</p>
               <p>Thus we find St. <hi>Peter</hi> attended by St. <hi>Mark</hi> whom he calls his Son; by St. <hi>Clement,</hi> ſo famous throughout all the <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 13.</note> Churches; St <hi>Evodius</hi> who ſucceeded him at <hi>Antioch;</hi> St. <hi>Linus</hi> and St. <hi>Cletus</hi> who ſucceeded him at <hi>Rome.</hi> With St. <hi>Paul</hi> we find St. <hi>Luke,</hi> St. <hi>Titus,</hi> St. <hi>Timothy,</hi> and the ſame St. <hi>Clement.</hi> With the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle St. <hi>John,</hi> we find St. <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <note place="margin">

This firſt Church was compoſed of Perſons of every Sex and Condition, and grew quickly very numerous: For there were three thouſand Converted at the firſt preaching of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and five thouſand at a ſecond.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57456:23"/> Perſons. (abſolute Continence being a thing rarely practiced in thoſe Days) They lived ſeparately; for 'tis ſaid, they went from houſe to houſe breaking bread, that is, Conſecrating and diſtributing the Holy Euchariſt; yet they lived in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, reducing all they had into ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which at firſt the Apoſtles, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſeven Deacons diſtributed to every one according to his need; and with ſuch fidelity and diſcretion did they man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age this affair, that there were no Poor amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Here therefore was to be ſeen a viſible and real Example of that Communication of Goods, and living in common, which the old Legiſlators and Philoſophers looked upon as the moſt proper means of making mankind happy; but without ever being able to bring it into practice: 'Twas to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt. polit. lib.</hi> 2.</note> compaſs this, and that <hi>Minos</hi> in the firſt times of <hi>Greece</hi> would have eſtabliſhed in <hi>Creet</hi> his <hi>Tabulae Communes,</hi> and that <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> took ſuch Precautions to baniſh from among the <hi>Lacedoemonians</hi> all exceſs, and the uſe of Riches. But <hi>Plato</hi> puſhes his Idea of Community a little too far, when to leave nothing uncommon, he was for taking away the diſtinction of Families. They well ſaw, that to make a perfect Society, there muſt be left no <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> no room for private and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57456:24"/> Intereſts. But they could onely make uſe of Penalties to conſtrain, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to perſwade Men to accept of their Regulations; and therefore all their labour was in vain. 'Twas only the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt that could change the Hearts of Men, and cure the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Natures.</p>
               <p>Thus this Communication of Goods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe Chriſtians of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the pure effect of that ſingular Charity with which the Goſpel had inſpired them, which made them all Brethren to each other, and as it were of one and the ſame Family; where out of one and the ſame Eſtate, the Father provides for all his Children, and loving them all equally, ſuffers none of them to want. They had always before their Eyes the Commandment of Jeſus Chriſt, of loving one another, ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by him, and particularly the night before he ſuffered, making this the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character by which all men were to know that they were his Diſciples. But that which obliged them to ſell their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, and reduce all into ready Mony, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 13 35.</note> was our Saviour's Command of forſaking all that they had; which they practiſed not only in the inward diſpoſition of the Heart, in which terminates the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Precept, but in reality of Fact, according to that Counſel of our Saviour
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57456:24"/>

                     <hi>Ma.</hi> 24. 34.</note> and that he had limited the time of it to be before that Generation ſhould paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; which made them willingly clear themſelves of all the concerns they had, either in that accurſed City it ſelf, or in the Country belonging to it, devoted to Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>So that the Believers living in common, was a practice peculiar to the firſt Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſuitable to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe times and Perſons. For it would have been an hard matter, at leaſt Humanly ſpeaking, for ſo numerous a Church to have long Subſiſted without the ſupport of ſome fixed Fund and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues that were certain; and by the Acts of the Apoſtles and the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> we ſee, that during the ſhort time of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 17.</note> it ſtood in need of Relief from other Churches, and that out of all the <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 3.</note> Provinces there were remitted conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſumms for the uſe of the Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> And yet St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſo <note place="margin">

                  </note> long time after ſticks not to propoſe this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57456:25"/> Example of Believers living in Common as a thing ſtill Practicable, and as a means of converting all the Infidels. 'Tis to be ſuppoſed that theſe Saints of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Laboured with their own Hands, ſince in ſo doing they did but follow the moſt perfect examples of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles; nor can we ſuppoſe any thing too perfect of them: And this was alſo a conſiderable means of ſupplying their want of fixed Revenues.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſaid that they continued ſtedfaſt in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and they are commonly called by the Name of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, from their applying themſelves to the Learning of the Doctrine of Salvation; both by hearing the Apoſtles, who made frequent Diſcourſes to them, and diligently Inſtructed them both in Publick and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, delivering to them the ſame ſaving Truths, they themſelves had received from the Lord: And likewiſe in reading the Holy Scriptures and conferring upon them among themſelves, 'Tis added that they continued in Prayer, and that they went Dayly to the Temple, aſſembling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Porch, and there with <note place="margin">Act. 3. 1.</note> one accord joyning in Prayer. The Example of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> going up together into the Temple at the hour of Prayer, being the Ninth hour, makes it probable, that they then obſerved the ſame
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57456:25"/> hours of Prayers which the Church hath <note place="margin">Baron. an. 34. 12. 250.</note> always ſince kept to. As to their outward way of living, they conformed themſelves to the reſt of the <hi>Jews,</hi> obſerving all the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law, even to the Offering of Sacrifices; which they continued to do as long as the Temple was ſtanding: And this is what the Fathers called, Giving the Synagogue an honourable Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <note place="margin">Aug. ep. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>After Prayer the Scripture takes notice of the breaking of Bread, by which there, as in ſeveral other Places of the New-Teſtament, is ſignifyed the Euchariſt. They Celebrated this Myſtery not in the Temple, where they could not be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty enough to do it, and where the Chriſtians were intermixed with the <hi>Jews;</hi> but in private Houſes with onely the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful amongſt themſelves. It was attended, as the Peace-Offerings under the Law, with a Repaſt; the uſe of which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for a long time amongſt Chriſtians under the Name of <hi>Agapae,</hi> which Word ſignifies Love, as much as to ſay, Love-Feaſts. It is ſaid, that theſe Feaſts were accompanyed with Gladneſs and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leneſs of Heart. And indeed all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by their Humility, Simplicity and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heart were as ſo many little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; Innocent and Inoffenſive. And by their renouncing the vain hopes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57456:26"/> of this Life, they cut off all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Vexatious and Diſquieting Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as leaving no matter for them to work upon, and having their Thoughts wholly taken up with the hopes of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the expectation of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, which they looked upon as very near at hand. And if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without wonder ſo much as Read that little which the Scripture hath left to us in Writing concerning the firſt Church, we may eaſily imagine how much they muſt have been beloved and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by thoſe who were the Spectators of their Vertues.</p>
               <p>This firſt Church Subſiſted at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> for near the ſpace of forty Years under the Direction of the Apoſtles, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of St. <hi>James</hi> their Biſhop; till the Chriſtians ſeeing, according to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of our Saviour, the Judgments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt that unhappy City near approaching, Seperated themſelves from the Unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> and retired to the little City of <hi>Pella,</hi> where they enjoyed a ſafe retreat, during the Siege of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>

               <p>IN the mean time there were formed ſeveral other Churches in divers parts of the World, Compoſed both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> which though they came not up <note place="margin">The time of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions. The ſtate of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> before their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</note> to this height of Perfection, yet were great Examples of Vertue and Holineſs; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we conſider the ſtate of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> before their Converſion.</p>
               <p>They who are unacquainted with the Hiſtory of paſt Ages are apt to imagine, that the Men who lived in the World ſixteen hundred Years ago were more ſimple, more innocent, and more eaſily nſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than are the Men of this Generation: And that becauſe they have heard ſay, that the World is in a ſtate of Declenſion and grows worſe and worſe; and becauſe they ſtill ſee the marks of the Simplicity and eaſie Temper of our honeſt Fore-Fathers. But they who have made any Reflection on the Writings left us by the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> plainly ſee the contrary. The Preaching of the Goſpel began under the Reigns of the Emperors <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Nero.</hi> What kind of Courts theſe Emperors had, and the Vices that there Reigned we may ſee in <hi>Tacitus:</hi> The Manners and practices of the ſame Age are to be ſeen in <hi>Horace,</hi> in <hi>Juvenal,</hi> in <hi>Martial,</hi> and in <hi>Petronius.</hi> That theſe Authors bluſhed not at the Infamous Impurities with which they have ſtuffed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57456:27"/> their Writings, is becauſe the Men of that Age bluſhed not to commit them. They thought they might take the Liberty of Publickly expoſing what others as Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly practiſed. And there ſeems to be a ſpecial Providence in it that theſe Books, otherwiſe ſo pernicious, ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to us, to ſhew out of what an Abyſs of Corruption, Jeſus Chriſt reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Mankind.

               <p>This Corruption of Manners took its courſe through <hi>Greece, Aegypt,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> 'Tis but caſting ones Eyes upon <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> to ſee to what height of Diſſolution the <hi>Greeks</hi> were even in thoſe Days arrived; and 'tis a thing but too certain that they did not after his time become more Wiſe; on the contrary, they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57456:27"/> made ſtill farther Improvements in Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury and Effeminacy. The Lives of the Kings of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> furniſhed Hiſtory with a New ſtock and variety of examples of the moſt mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Vices and Impurities. 'Tis well known for what <hi>Alexandria, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Corinth</hi> were famed, and how noted for their Voluptouſneſs and Effeminacy were the Cities of <hi>Jonia</hi> and the <hi>Leſſer Aſia:</hi> Yet in the midſt of this general Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was it, that Chriſtianity took its Birth: 'twas in the midſt of theſe very Cities that the moſt famous Churches were foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. This Diſſolution was not onely Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verfal, overſpreading the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; but publick, open, avowed and Authoriſed, nay even Conſecrated by their Religion its ſelf. Learned Men know what were the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and <hi>Cybele.</hi> Wherever one paſſed one met with a <hi>Venus,</hi> an <hi>Adonis,</hi> a <hi>Gany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mede,</hi> and a <hi>Jupiter</hi> in all Diſguiſes. There was not a Garden or Orchard without the Idol of that Ridiculous God whom they made the Guardian of the Place. Their common Songs and Poems were upon the Amours of their Gods, and moſt of their Publick Spectacles, were abominable Scenes either of Impurity or Cruelty.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:57456:28"/>
               <p>The ordinary Divertiſements of the <hi>Roman</hi> People were to force Men to fight and Murder one another, or to ſee them torn to pieces by Wild Beaſts: Frequently upon the moſt trifling occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they put their Slaves to the Rack, and to the moſt horrible Tortures. The Governours of Provinces did often exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe exceſſive Cruelties upon ſuch as were not <hi>Romans.</hi> The Emperors put to Death whomſoever they pleaſed, without any Form of Law, ſo that bad Princes ſpilt a great deal of Blood, even of the moſt Noble <hi>Romane</hi> themſelves. Nor was their Avarice inferior to their Cruelty. All the World Groaned under their Frauds, Perjuries, Falſities, unjuſt proſecutions and violent Oppreſſions; of all which, we need no other proof than <hi>Cicero's</hi> Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>Such then were thoſe out of whom were made thoſe Chriſtians I am going to deſcribe. When once they were waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Sanctifyed, they were no longer <note place="margin">I <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. xi.</note> the ſame Creatures they had been before: Yet not to conceal that Good that was in them, we muſt not diſown but that there were in many of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> ſome kind of hopeful Diſpoſitions and Tendencies towards Vertue.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, they had much of that Politeneſs that neceſſarily carries along with it many good qualities, which we may call ſuperficial Vertues as Gravity, Pacience and Obligingneſs in Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Complaiſance, Chearfulneſs, and a lively way of expreſſing their Eſteem or Affection, with a true ſence of <hi>Decorum</hi> and decency in every Action, of which the <hi>Greeks</hi> were compleat Maſters. All this a Man may have without ſolid Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or be wanting in theſe things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being an ill Man, or a vicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: And yet Vertue ſeems not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly perfect without this exteriour Dreſs to recommend her Beauty, and ſet her off to advantage. Beſides this, there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, the <hi>Greeks</hi> eſpecially, many true Philoſophers, that is to ſay, Perſons who did in good earneſt, and with the utmoſt powers of their Reaſon ſeek after the means of becoming Happy; who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57456:29"/> laboured to come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Recognit. Clem. init.</note> of the Truth, who honeſtly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the practice of Vertue <note place="margin">Juſtin. in.

Nor were the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally Degenerate, but that there were many among them who maintained that Generoſity, that Greatneſs of Soul, that Conſtancy and firmneſs of Mind, and other ſuch like Vertues for which their Anceſtors were ſo Renowned,</p>
               <p>The Grace of the Goſpel being ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to theſe happy diſpoſitions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, could not but produce admirable Effects. St. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> the firſt of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that teceived this Grace, was a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Captain. The bravery of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſpirit appears in many of the glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, as St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> St. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſtian,</hi> and in many great Biſhops; as St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Leo,</hi> &amp;c. As for the Gravity of the <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers, one may ſee it in the Acts of S. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> in thoſe of St <hi>Pionius,</hi> Prieſt of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and in the Writings of St. <hi>Juſtin</hi> and St. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and in the ſame writings we alſo find a vaſt reach of Learning, joined
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57456:29"/> with the fineſt Politeneſs. The Humility of a Chriſtian having qualified the haughty Air of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the ſcornful Pride of the Philoſophers, made of them true Sages: Faith having once diſcovered to them the true end upon which they ought to fix, from that time forward they mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing elſe. Theſe Perſons (even in their Gentile ſtate) ſo improved, and refin'd being now by the grace of the Goſpel fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleanſed from all their Impurities, and having learnt to be ſincere, became alſo Gentle, Meek and Peaceable, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Artifice and Diſguiſe.</p>
               <p>Thus the Chriſtian Religion eſtabliſhed its ſelf in the midſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and in <hi>Rome</hi> its ſelf, when it was in its moſt flouriſhing Condition, in the moſt enlightened Age that ever was; and at the ſame time the moſt corrupt. Nor could the Divinity of the Goſpel more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly have diſplayed its Power, than in triumphing over thoſe two diſpoſitions in Man, that are moſt oppoſite to it; that is Vanity of Knowledge and Corruption of Manners; ſo victoriouſly carrying on its Progreſſe in the World; while on the one hand Science, an exalted Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding reſiſted the ſimplicity of its Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; and the Humility of Faith, on the other, Depravity of Heart, and corruption of Manners, oppoſed the purity of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57456:30"/> and the ſeverity of its practices. This was neceſſary to be the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly inſiſted on, that none may imagine as if the Apoſtles had to do with only a Groſs heavy ſort of People, that might eaſily be made to believe any thing that was told them. And this Conſideration hath <hi>Tertullian</hi> long ſince urged againſt the Heathens <hi>'Twas not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>with Jeſus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apolo. c. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt as with</hi> Numa. <hi>He had a rough unhewn ſort of People to deal with, ſtupid and eaſy be to impoſed on; and therefore to tame and break them into ſome kind of Diſcipline, invented a Religion ſuited to their groſs Capacities, and proper to ſerve his ends; embarreſſed them with a multitude of Deities, and preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a number of Ceremonies, by which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them of their Favour. But Jeſus Christ coming into the World, when Learning was at its height, when Men were blinded with too much Wiſdom, and Knowledge was their Diſeaes; even then opened their Eyes to the diſcerning of the Truth, and made Faith to Triumph over Philoſophy.</hi>

In time they began to publiſh ſome Writings, to ſhew the Heathens upon what weak Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Pagan Worſhip ſtood, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage them from their Prejudices; ſuch are St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr's Admonition</hi> to the Gentiles, and that of St. <hi>Clemens Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drinus.</hi> But that by which they moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, was Miracles, (yet frequently in the Church) the holy Lives of Chriſtians, and their conſtancy in ſuffering Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

               <p>When any one deſired to become a Chriſtian, they lead him to the Biſhop, or to ſome Prieſt, who in the firſt place took him into Examination, to ſee whether his Profeſſion was ſincere and well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <note place="margin">

               <p>THE greateſt part of their Prayers was <note place="margin">VI. The Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> made up of the Pſalms, which being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with a Grave and diſtinct Voice were highly Inſtructive, as containing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57456:34"/> in them a kind of ſummary or Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what lyes more diſpers'd in the other ſacred Books, and ſupplying a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of thoſe thoughts and reflexions which a Man ſhould make in every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <note place="margin">Athanas.

With the Pſalms they always joyned the reading of ſome other parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and from thence came in the little Chapters of the Hours. As the Night Prayers were always the Longeſt, ſo they had more <hi>Leſſons</hi> belonging to them: And as the Maſs is the moſt ſolemn part of all the Office, ſo it is that which had more of the Inſtructive part mixed with the Devotional. Nothing was read in the Church as Scripture and of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration but what was received into the Canon; that is to ſay, ſuch as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Tradition of the Churches had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed. Thoſe other Writings which ſome Private Perſons would have introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced where called Apocryphal, that is, hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den or obſcure. To ſecure the Eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Books from all change, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Boldneſs nor careleſſneſs of the Tranſcribers, might make any Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in them, there was ſometimes Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them a Proteſtation Conjuring in the name of God, whoſoever ſhould Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Writing to do it Faithfully.

               <p>The Church therefore was not only the Houſe of Prayer, but the School of Salvation. The Biſhops expounded to the People the Goſpel and the other ſacred Books, with the diligence of a publick Profeſſor, but with far greater Authority. And therefore in the Stile of the Ancients the Title of Doctor, that is Teacher, is ſcarce given to any but Biſhops.

               <p>Beſides the Scriptures themſelves, the Chriſtians had alſo for their reading the Writings of their Biſhops and other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Authors; plenty of whom, and thoſe of great Note, theſe firſt Ages produced. <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives us an account <note place="margin">Euſeb. iv. <hi>et</hi> v. <hi>Hiſt.</hi>

Not but that the greateſt part of the Biſhops of theſe times, declined Writing Books, out of Modeſty, for fear of divulging the Myſteries of their Religion, for want of Leiſure, and by reaſon of the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which ſuffered but a few of them, to Live any great Age.

And they took care to chuſe ſuch callings as were moſt conſiſtent with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement and Humility. Many of their Rich ones reduced themſelves to a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Poverty by diſtributing what they had among the Poor; eſpecially in times of Perſecution, thereby to put themſelves
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57456:38"/> in a readineſs for Martyrdom. The firſt Diſciples of the Apoſtles, who laboured together with them in the Propagation of the Goſpel, practiced the ſame Method; but for a nobler end. They ſold their Poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſions, and gave the price of them to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euſ.</hi> iii. 17.</note> the Poor, that ſo they might be more diſengaged, and at liberty to quit their Country, Travel abroad, and carry the Goſpel into the moſt diſtant parts of the World.

For they were earneſtly exhorted to ſhun this particular Vice among many others, the inſeparable Companions of it; as a reſtleſs temper, Curioſity, Dectrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, inſignificant Viſits, Gadding and Rambling, Prying into and Cenſuring the Actions of their Neighbours. On the contrary, all Perſons were adviſed to keep themſelves quiet and not meddle in other Mens matters, and to be employed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome uſeful Buſineſs, but principally in the Works of Charity toward the Sick, the Poor, and all others whoſe Condition required their Aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtians Life therefore, was a continued courſe of Prayer, Reading and Labour, which regularly ſucceeded one the other in their proper Hours, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no other interuptions than juſt what the neceſſities of Life required. But what
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57456:38"/> Occupation ſoever they followed, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made it but as by-work in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Religion, which they look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">

They pretended not to any particular Profeſſion or Denomination; but purely and ſimply to be Chriſtians. They owned no other Title or Character but that; and when the Judge Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them concerning their name, their Country, their Quality; their anſwer to all was, <hi>I am a Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They liked not ſuch Employments as too much buſy and diſſipate the Thoughts, as Merchandizing, Soliciting of Buſineſs, bearing Publick Offices: Yet they always continued in the Callings they followed <note place="margin">

Their Faſts. <hi>Mat.</hi> ix. xv.</note> to what our Saviour had ſaid; That after he ſhould be taken from them, his Diſciples ſhould Faſt. From the very firſt Ages of Chriſtianity in Remembrance of this; that is, of the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, they had their fixed and ſolemn Faſts; as that of <hi>Lent</hi> for every Year; and of <hi>Wedneſday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> for every Week: They Faſted alſo for the Ordinations; and upon ſeveral other occaſions, when the Biſhops preſcribed Faſts for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Neceſſities; toſay nothing now
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57456:39"/> of their Pennances and particular Devo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>On their Faſts they eat but once a Day, and that not till towards the Evening; that is, in <hi>Lent,</hi> not till after the <hi>Veſpers,</hi> toward the beginning of the Night; and on other Days not till after three a Clock; and ſuch were their ordinary Faſts. They had alſo their greater Faſts; as that of the holy Week, the whole of <note place="margin">v. Ep. Can. Dion. alex.</note> which, many amonſt them paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating, at leaſt the three laſt Days of it. Many alſo out of their private Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion kept their particular Faſts to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and abſtained from eating for two or three Days together; eſpecially upon great Occaſions, as when they prepared themſelves for Martyrdom: Some there were who paſſed whole Weeks or ten <note place="margin">Luc. in Philopatr.</note> Days without taking any Food, as <hi>Lucian</hi> (an unſuſpected Witneſs in this Matter) aſſures us. All in general on their Faſt-Days abſtained from drinking Wine and eating Fleſh; the greateſt part fed only on Herbs or Pulſe, with a little Bread, others allowed themſelves little Fiſhes; but on thoſe Days never uſe any ſort of high Sauces or reliſhing Delicacies: They confined themſelves to cheap and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diet, always expending leſs upon their Tables on Faſt-Days, then at other Seaſons. Some obſerved <hi>Omophagy;</hi> that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57456:40"/> is to ſay, eating their Food raw and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed; others <hi>Xerophagy;</hi> that is, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only upon dry Diets, as Nuts, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds and ſuch like Fruits; and others confined themſelves only to Bread and Water.</p>
               <p>I know that Men will now a Days think themſelves little concerned with theſe Examples: They imagin that theſe ancient Auſterities are now become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable. The ſtrength of Nature, ſay they, is impaired by the courſe of ſo many Years: Men do not live ſo long now as they did of old; nor are their Bodies ſo Robuſt. But I would fain have them give ſome Proofs of this alteration; for we are not here ſpeaking of the Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick times of antient <hi>Greece,</hi> nor of the Lives of the Patriarches, nor of thoſe who lived before the Flood: We are upon the times of the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and of the other <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Writers, ſufficiently known to us. Let them drive the matter as far as they pleaſe, they will not be able to ſhew that the Life of Man hath been ſhortned for ſixteen hundred Years: From thence, and from a long time before, the Age of Man was limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Threeſcore and ten, or fourſcore <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſ.</hi> xc. x.</note> Years. In the firſt Age of Chriſtianity, though there were as yet ſome <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57456:40"/> 
                  <hi>Romans</hi> who practiced the Gymnaſtick Exerciſes to preſerve their Bodies in good Health; yet there were more who enfeeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them by their exceſſes; particularly by thoſe kind of Debauches which tend moſt to the ruin of Health, and which ſtill make ſo many of the Eaſtern People grow old ſo long before their time. In the mean time, out of theſe moſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places, as <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> came the greateſt Faſters, and theſe Perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed the term of their Lives beyond other Men. 'Tis true ſuch Faſting was a thing more eaſily practiced by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thoſe hot Countries, than it can be by us. And yet we find great Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Abſtinence, even in <hi>Gaul,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colder Regions; and that more than a Thouſand Years after the Apoſtles; for the ancient Rule of Faſting (as we ſhall ſee hereafter) continued down to the time of St. <hi>Bernard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chriſtians, as well as <hi>Jews,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Faſting as a State of Affliction: 'Tis true, the <hi>Jews</hi> applied it to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the natural Paſſion of Grief; as when they faſted upon the loſs of ſome dear Friend or Relation; or upon any other misfortune purely Temporal: To the ſame purpoſe was it practiced by other Nations. And we find that the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> together with other ſigns
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57456:41"/> of Mourning, joined that of Faſting. But the Chriſtians applied all to a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual end; uſing theſe exteriour Teſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Grief only as they tended to excite in them that Godly ſorrow that worketh <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. x.</note> Repentance to Salvation; that is, to give them Compunction for their Sins. A ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian, ought to lament the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cypr. de Laps. Chrys. de Compunct.</note> 
                  <hi>Death of his Soul, at leaſt as much as the loſs of a Friend;</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> makes uſe of the ſame Compariſon. They conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faſting alſo as a Preſervative againſt Temptation by weakning the Fleſh, and and bringing it into Subjection to the Spirit; and therefore with their Faſtings, they Joyned the Abſtaining from all ſorts of Pleaſures even the moſt Innocent. <hi>Marryed Perſons</hi> during thoſe Seaſons, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Continence. They all in general lived in greater Silence and Solitude, were more frequent in viſiting the Churches, and ſpent more of their Hours in Reading and Praying on their Faſt-Days than at other times.</p>
               <p>IN their Diet, and way of Eating, <note place="margin">IX. Their Eating.</note> the Chriſtians alwaies (even out of their Faſt-Days) obſerved great Frugality and Moderation. They were taught not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Clem. Alex. ii. <hi>Paedag.</hi> i.</note> to Live to Eat, but to Eat to Live. That the end of Food being Health and Strength, and the keeping the Body in a condition
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57456:41"/> fit for Labour; all bcyond this was Superfluous and Exceſſive. Twas not therefore for a Chriſtian to Study the Art of Eating, or to Indulge the wantonneſs of the Appetite; to hanker after curious Diſhes, ſumptuous Feaſts, or thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies of the Palate which could not come to the Table, without the Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of skilful Cooks and the Science of the Kitchen. They applyed to themſelves that ſaying of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in a literal Sence, and made a general Rule of it: <hi>It is good</hi>

                  </note> the taſting pleaſure in the things I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57456:45"/> have mentioned is Vicious, or at leaſt Dangerous; and a Chriſtian even in the moſt Innocent matters ought to Regulate himſelf with the greateſt Sobriety and Moderation. Indeed the whole Life of a Chriſtian ſhould be taken up in little elſe, than in expiating his paſt Sins by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and in Guarding himſelf againſt the like for the future by the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Paſſions. The true penitent to Chaſtiſe himſelf for having Abuſed the Pleaſures, of ſence, muſt begin by denying himſelf even the Lawful uſe of them, and to extinguiſh, or at leaſt weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en natural Concupiſcence, muſt (as much as is poſſible) deny all its Cravings. So that a true Chriſtian muſt never make it his buſineſs to ſeek the pleaſures of Sence, but juſt take ſomuch of them as the neceſſities of Life require, and which cannot be withheld; as Eating, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and neceſſary Repoſe; if ever he take any Recreation, it muſt be a Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation properly ſo called, that is to ſay a Refreſhment and Eaſe, to Recreate or relieve the weakneſs of Nature, which would ſink under the weight were the Body always kept up to hard Labours, or the Mind always bent upon cloſe Thinking. But to ſeek Pleaſure for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures Sake, and as making it our end: Nothing can be more contrary to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57456:46"/> we lye under of Renouncing our ſelves, which is the very Life and Soul of all Chriſtian Vertues.</p>
               <p>This Serious and mortifyed Diſpoſition of the true Chriſtians appears even from the Genius of the Hereſies of theſe firſt times, which for the moſt part were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by an exceſs of Diſcipline and corporal Auſterity. The <hi>Marcionites,</hi> and after them the <hi>Manichees,</hi> held that the Fleſh was an Evil thing, as being the work of the evil Principle, and therefore concluded that it was not lawful either to eat Fleſh, or to multiply it by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, and that the Reſurrection of the Fleſh, was a thing neither to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected nor deſired. This contempt of the Body, this Abſtinence and Continence made a very ſpecious Appearance. The <hi>Montaniſts</hi> added many other Faſts as of neceſſary Obligation to thoſe apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church; condemned ſecond Marriages, and wholy diſallowed of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as not granting that the Church had Power to reſtore them who had, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Baptiſm fallen into the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of any grievous Sin. He that ſhould now a Days advance Errors of thsi Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would ſcarce gain many Proſelytes.</p>
               <p>But how ſevere ſoever the Life of thoſe Primitive Chriſtians may appear to have been; yet we are not to imagine it was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57456:46"/> ſad and Melancholy. St. <hi>Paul</hi> required no <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> iv. iv.</note> impoſſible thing of them, when he bid them rejoyce; if they denied themſelves thoſe Exceſſes of Pleaſure which other Men hunt after, they were freed alſo from all that Chagrin and other Paſſions which are ſo very troubleſom; leading a Life free from Ambition, from Covetouſneſs, and all Fond doating upon the things of this Life. They enjoyed the Peace of a good Conſcience, the Reflexions of a well ſpent Life; and the aſſurance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon following of their being in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God; and above all, the bleſſed hopes of the Life to come, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways looked upon as near at Hand: For they knew that this World muſt ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſs away; and the Perſecutions ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be but forerunners of the univerſal Judgment.</p>
               <p>So that they little troubled their Thoughts about what would become of their Families after their Death: If they left their Children Orphans, as was often the Caſe of the Martyrs, they knew that the Church would be their Mother, and that they ſhould want for nothing. They lived for the moſt part only from Hand to Mouth, upon their Labour, or upon their Eſtates, which they divided among the Poor, without diſtraction of Thought, without the hurry of Buſineſs; ſtanding
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57456:47"/> off not only from all ſordid Methods of Gain, or whatſoever might bear the leaſt ſuſpicion of injuſtice, but alſo from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deſire of heaping up Treaſures and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching themſelves; ſo that the Prelates complain of it as a great diſorder, and a <note place="margin">Cpyr. de Laps.</note> new thing among Chriſtians, that in the intervals of the Perſecutions, they began to forget themſelves, and fell to getting Eſtates; as if they were for eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to themſelves Manſions upon Earth. And they that ſtood thus indifferent to Earthly Poſſeſſions, could have no great hankering after ſenſual Pleaſures: and if in theſe things we do not at leaſt in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our Deſires emulate them, we are no good Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>WITH all this indifferency to the things <note place="margin">XI. Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> of this Life; yet the Chriſtians generally made choice of the Married State: They could have no good opinion of the Celi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacy of the Heathens; ſince they ſaw it founded only upon Licentiouſneſs and Debauchery. So that the Civil Laws themſelves aimed at the reſtraint of it, both by affixing ſome kind of Penalties <note place="margin">

               <p>But how highly ſoever they eſteemed Continence, they had an eſteem for Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as being a great Sacrament: They had honourable Thoughts of it, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it as an Emblem of that Union which is between Chriſt and his Church, and that Bleſſing Pronounced by God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mankind at the firſt Creation; which <note place="margin">Orat. in Bened.

The name of <hi>Eccleſia, i. e.</hi> Church, ſignifies no more than an Aſſembly, and was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> for a meeting of the People, who commonly came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Theatre, for the diſpatch of Publick Affairs. We have in the Acts of the Apoſtles an Example of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 32</note> 
                  <hi>Eccleſia</hi> or Aſſembly in the City of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and therefore the Chriſtians by way of diſtinction from theſe profane <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſias,</hi> where called the <hi>Eccleſia</hi> or Church of God. <hi>Origen</hi> in his Diſpute againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> compares theſe two ſorts of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies together, and lays it down as a thing certain and manifeſt, that the leſs Zeal of the Chriſtians (who were but few in compariſon of the reſt) did ſomuch excel other Men, That the Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies appeared in the World like Stars in the Firmament. The Chriſtians there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of every City made up but one Body; and this was one principal pretence of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57456:49"/> Perſecuting them. Their Aſſemblies were repreſented as Illegal Meetings, not being Authorized by the Laws of the State. Their Unity and Love paſſed fot a Crime, and was Objected againſt them as a dangerous Confederacy.</p>
               <p>And indeed all the Chriſtians living in the ſame Place were well known to each other; as it could not be otherwiſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how often they joined in Prayer, and other exerciſes of Religion, upon which occaſions they met together almoſt every Day. They all maintained a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Correſpondence among themſelves; often met and conferred together, and even in indifferent matters conformed to one another. Their Joys and their Griefs were in common: If any one had received of God any particular Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, they all ſhared the ſatisfaction. If any one were under Pennance, they all Interceeded on his behalf, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that Mercy might be ſhewn him. They lived together as kindred of the ſame Family, calling one another by the Name of Father or Child, Brother or Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, according to the difference of Age or Sex.</p>
               <p>This Unity was maintained by that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which every Maſter of a Family had over thoſe of his own Houſe; and by the Submiſſion that all of them paid to the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57456:49"/> Prieſts and their Biſhops; a Duty ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly recommended to Chriſtians in the Epiſtles of the holy Martyr St. <hi>Ignatius:</hi> But above all, the Biſhops were moſt cloſely United<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among themſelves. They all knew one another, at leaſt by their Names and Characters, and held a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Epiſtolary Correſpondence; which was eaſy to be done at that time, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the vaſt extent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; <note place="margin">

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57456:51"/> the breaking of Bread, the Oblation; or by the names afterward received in the Church, as the <hi>Synaxis;</hi> that is to ſay, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, <note place="margin">

In the time of the Perſecutions, for fear of meeting with diſturbance from the Infidels, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times adminiſtred it before Day. There was but one Sacrifice in each Church; that is, in each Dioceſs: 'Twas the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that Offered it; nor did the Prieſts do it, but in caſe of the abſence or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of the Biſhop. But they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted him in performing the Service, and all of them Offered together with him. The Order of the Liturgy hath been changed according to the difference of Times and Places: Some Indifferent Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies have been added to it, and ſome others retrenched; but the Eſſentials have remained always the ſame. The Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we find of it in the firſt Times, is this;</p>

That ended, they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57456:51"/> all roſe up, and turning their Faces to the Eaſt, with hands lift up to Heaven, they Prayed for all ſorts and Conditions of Men, for Chriſtians and Infidels, great and ſmall; particularly for all that were any ways afflicted or diſtreſſed in Mind, Body, or Eſtate. A Deacon called upon them to Pray, a Prieſt pronounced the Words of Prayer, and the People gave their Aſſent by anſwering, Amen. Then <note place="margin">Cypr. <hi>Ep.</hi> lxiii.</note> the Gifts were offered, that is the Bread and Wine, mingled with Water, which was to be the matter of the Sacrifice. The People gave the Kiſs of Peace, Men to Men, and Women to Women in token of their perfect Unity. After that every one gave his Offerings to the Prieſt, and he in the name of them all offered them up to God. Then he began the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">Cypr. <hi>de.

                  </note> of the Sacrifice, calling upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to lift up their Hearts to God, and with the Angels and all the Heavenly powers to Laud and Magnifie his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name; next he proceeded to repeat the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noucing the Words of our Saviour, he <note place="margin">

               <p>As for thoſe who had not the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of aſſiſting at the Sacrifice in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Euchariſt was ſent to them by the Hands of Deacons or the <hi>Acolythi.</hi> They reſerved part of it alſo to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in readineſs for the Viaticum for Dying Perſons, as a proviſion for their Journy.

Theſe things were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in thoſe Days. For they had not then the liberty of meeting together and celebrating the Myſteries when they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. That which was thus carryed abroad was onely the Bread. Though in their publick Aſſemblies all in General com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated under both kinds, excepting little Children, to whom was given on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Wine. The <hi>Agapa</hi> or Love-Feaſt, which in theſe firſt times followed the Communion, was a Repaſt of ordinary Food, which they took altogether in the ſame place, where they had Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated.

The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the Myſteries.</note> (as far as was poſſible) they Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the other Sacraments, which was the cauſe of the ſpecial care they took not to admit any Infidel.

This is the reaſon why they called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by the name of Myſteries, that is to ſay things Concealed, and that they kept them to themſelves with a ſacred ſecreſy. They kept them concealed not only from the Infidels, but from the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens</hi> alſo. They not only declined to Celebrate the Myſteries before them, but would not ſo much as inform them what was done at the Celebration, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in their preſence the ſolemn words, nor Speak a ſyllable in their Hearing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature of the Sacraments. Much leſs did they Write upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And if in their publick Diſcourſe, or in any Writing which might fall into profane Hands, they were obliged to Speak of the Euchariſt, or of any other Myſtery, they did it in obſcure and Aenigmatical <note place="margin">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57456:53"/> break Bread, ſignifies to conſecrate and diſtribute the Euchariſt, a Phraſe by which the Infidels could not gueſs what was meant. This Diſcipline of the Church Continued for many Ages after the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions ceaſed.</p>
               <p>'Twas not ſtrange to the Heathens to ſee Myſteries in Religion: They themſelves obſerved the like in their Profane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. They who were Initiated into the Myſteries of <hi>Iſis,</hi> or <hi>Oſiris,</hi> or <hi>Ceres E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuſinia,</hi> or <hi>Cybele,</hi> or the <hi>Samothracian</hi> Gods, or other ſuch like, were bound under the moſt dreadful Maledictions to conceal the ſecret of the Myſteries; and he that ſhould have divulged them, would have been looked upon as a moſt accurſed Wretch.

And whether
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57456:56"/> it were all done by trick, or whether they were really aſſiſted by ſome evil Spirit; they impoſed upon the Eye ſight, and did actually perform many ſtrange Feats, to the Amazement of the Beholders; ſo that 'twas no new thing to hear talk of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; nay, nor to ſee them.

               <p>'Tis true the Morals of Chriſtians were very Exact, and their Practiſes anſwered their Principles. But all the World was then full of Philoſophers, who pretended no leſs than the Chriſtians both to the teaching of Vertue, and to the Practiſing of it. There were among them alſo many who in the firſt Ages of the Church, (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in Imitation of the Chriſtians) ran about the World from Place to Place
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57456:58"/> pretending to make it their buſineſs to reform Mankind, and thereupon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to many Hardſhips, and undergoing a kind of Perſecution by the ill Treatment they ſometimes met with, as <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus Muſonius,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V. Baron an. l</hi> xxv. <hi>n.</hi> 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Damis, Epictetus,</hi> and ſome others. The Philoſophers had for many Ages before been in great Reputation. 'Twas taken <note place="margin">Orig. Con. Cels.</note> for granted that nothing more could be added to what had already been ſaid by ſome of them. They could not imagin that <hi>Barbarians</hi> ſhould have any thing better to offer than <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato,</hi> or <hi>Zeno.</hi> They concluded that if theſe new Pretenders had any thing that was good in them, 'twas but ſomewhat which they had borrowed from thoſe Old Sages.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the Philoſophers were a more Agreeable ſort of Profeſſors, and their Principles better Accommodated to the inclinations of Mankind, than thoſe of the Chriſtians. The greateſt part of them did not condemn Pleaſure, nay ſome of them made Pleaſure the Sovereign good. They left every one to enjoy his own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and take his own way of Living. If they could not perſwade Men, their method was to rally and diſpiſe them; and that was all the trouble they gave them. But above all they took care not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57456:59"/> to pick Quarrels with the eſtabliſhed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions. Some believed them, and gave Myſtical Explications of the moſt Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Fables. Others troubled their Heads no farther about matters of Religion, then to Acknowledge ſome firſt being, the Author of Nature, leaving the publick Superſtitions to thoſe whom they believed incapable of higher attainments. Even the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who of all others diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered themſelves the moſt Openly againſt the popular opinions concerning the Gods, <note place="margin">Aſſiſto Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinis Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> yet freely Aſſiſted at the Sacrifices, and in what part of the World So ever they were, joyned with the reſt in the outward Forms of Religious Worſhip there Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed. In this all their Wiſe Men agreed, not to oppoſe the Cuſtomes eſtabliſhed either by the Laws of the Countrey or Preſcription of Time.</p>
               <p>Their Belief of a Plurality of Gods went ſo far that they imagined every Nation, every City, every Family had Gods of its own, who took a more peculiar care of them, and whom therefore they were to Worſhip after a more peculiar Manner. So that they counted all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions good in ſuch Places where they had been of a long time Received. But the Superſtitious Women among them, and other Weak and Ignorant People were always hunting after new Religions,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57456:59"/> imagining that the more Gods and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes they worſhipped, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter number and varietie of Ceremonies they obſerved, the more Devout and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious they were. The Wiſe Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Liv.</hi> xxix.</note> them and their Politicians did what they could to Reſtrain this reſtleſs Humour and keep it within ſome Bounds; and therefore were againſt all Innovations in matters of this Nature. Above all they Forbad all ſtrange and Forreign Religions; and this the <hi>Romans</hi> made a Fundamental Principle of their Politicks. To perſwade their People to believe that 'twas to the Beneficence of their Tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Deitys that <hi>Rome</hi> was beholding for all its Glorious Succeſſes, and the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of its Empire. That their Gods muſt needs have been more Puiſſant Deitys than any of the reſt, ſince they had brought under their Subjection all the Nations of the World. Thus when the Chriſtian Religion was entirely eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the <hi>Pagans</hi> failed not to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to this Change of Religion, the Fall of the Empire which Succeeded ſoon upon it. And to anſwer theſe Falſe Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions, was St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his large Treatiſe entituled <hi>De Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate Dei.</hi>

               <p>The Contempt the Chriſtians had of Death, was not by the Heathens looked
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57456:60"/> upon as any great matter. They ſaw every Day their voluntier Gladiators, who for ſome inconſiderable Reward, or perhaps for juſt nothing at all but to ſhew their own Bravery, fearleſsly expoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Swords of their Antagoniſts, and ventured having their Throats Cut in the open <hi>Amphitheatre.</hi> They had Dayly examples before them of Perſons (and thoſe of the beſt ſort) who upon any little Diſguſt would fairly Diſpatch themſelves out of the World.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57456:62"/> gently tied to a Bed of Roſes, and under the moſt delightſome Circumſtances, with an Immodeſt Harlot placed by his ſide; but ſo far was he from being overcome with the Temptation, that he bit of his Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue and ſpit in her Face; in ſhort, there were a multitude of Martyrs Maſſacred or put to Torments, without any form of Juſtice; either by the Fury of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Populace, or by the revenge of their particular Enemies.</p>
               <p>The Perſecution generally opened with ſome Edict, forbidding the Aſſemblies of the Chriſtians, and condeming to certain Penalties all thoſe who refuſed to Sacrifice to the Gods. The Biſhops preſently gave <note place="margin">

               <p>When the Chriſtians were Apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they were caried before the the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and by him Interrogated in open Court. If they denied themſelves to be Chriſtians, they were generally diſmiſſed upon their own bare Word: For they knew that thoſe who were true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians would never deny their Faith, or that if they did once deny themſelves to be Chriſtians, they would effectually ceaſe to be ſo. Yet ſometimes for greater
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57456:64"/> Aſſurance they made them do upon the ſpot ſome act of Idolatry, or utter ſome Contumelious Word againſt Jeſus Chriſt. If they confeſſed themſelves to be Chriſtians, then they endeavoured to beat them off from their Conſtancy, firſt by Perſwaſions or Promiſes, then by threatnings, or if neither of thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, at laſt by Torments. They tried alſo to ſurprize them into the involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Commiſſion of ſome Impiety; and then to make them believe that they had already Renounced their Religion; and that 'twas now too late to Recant. As they were brought upon their Trials in the Court, there were always ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near them ſome Idol and Altar: There the Heathens offered Victims in their Preſence, and tried to make them eat ſome part of the Sacrifice; wrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open their Mouths, and forcing down their Throats ſome bit of Fleſh or at <note place="margin">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57456:64"/> there for a long time, leaſt in throwing away the Coals they ſhould at the ſame time ſeem to offer the Incence.</p>
               <p>The moſt uſual Tortures they were put to was, to ſtretch them out at Length <note place="margin">Eqvuleus.</note> upon the Rack or Wooden Horſe, with Cords tyed to their Feet and Hands, and drawn at both ends with Pullies, or to Hang them up by the Hands with heavy weights faſtned to their Feet: to beat them with Rods or great Clubs, or with Whips ſtuck with ſharp peices of Iron, which they called Scorpions, or with Thongs of raw Leather, or Leather loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Balls of Lead; ſo that many of them Dyed under the Blows. Others they ſtretched out at Length; Burnt and tore their Fleſh and Skin aſunder, either with Pincers, or Iron Curry-Combs; ſo that they often Bared them to the very Ribs, and opened the Hollow of their Bowels till, the Fire pierced into their Entrails and Choaked them to Death. To make their wounds yet more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, they ſome times rubbed them over with Salt and Uinegar, and as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to cloſe up Rip't them open again.</p>
               <p>During all the time of their Torments they were ſtill putting Queſtions to them, and every thing that was Spoken either by the Judge or by the party Suffering, was taken down in writing Word for
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57456:65"/> Word, by the publick Notaires: So that upon every Tryal there was left upon Record a verbal Proceſs far more exact than any of thoſe made now a Days, by the Officers of our Courts of Juſtice. For as the Ancients had the Art of Writing by Abreviatures, or a ſort of ſhort Notes where every ſingle Character ſtood for a word, they wrote as faſt as they Spake. and took down preciſely the very ſelf ſame Words that were Utter'd, making every one Speak directly and in his own Perſon, whereas in our verbal Proceſſes all the Diſcourſe runs in the Third-perſon, and the whole is put into order, and worded by the Regiſter.</p>
               <p>Theſe verbal Proceſſes were what they called Acts. The Chriſtians were very careful to get Copies of theſe Proceſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Brethren: And out of thoſe Acts, as well as from what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who were preſent farther obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, were the Paſſions of the Martyrs reduce into Writing, and thus Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically engroſſed and preſerved in the Churches. At <hi>Rome</hi> St. <hi>Clement</hi> ſet up <note place="margin">Lib. Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cif. in Clem.</note> ſeven Notaries, every one of which had the Charge of this Affair, and two Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the City aſſigned him: And St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives it as a ſpecial Direction to <note place="margin">Cypr. ep. xxxvi.</note> his Prieſts and Deacons, that they ſhould
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57456:65"/> carefully note the particular Day on which every one ſuffered Martyrdom. The greateſt part of theſe Acts of the Martyrs were loſt in the <hi>Diocletian</hi> Perſecution, and though <hi>Euſebius Ceſarienſis</hi> had made a great Collection of them, yet that is loſt too. So that we have but few of them now remaining. Yet the Names of the moſt eminent Martyrs are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the <hi>Menologies</hi> and <hi>Martyrologies,</hi> which ſet down for every Day the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, of the Day and the Place, where their Feaſts are Colebrated; to which were afterwards added the other Saints.</p>
               <p>During theſe Interrogatories, they were Preſſed to Diſcover their Complices, that is the other Chriſtians, and Particularly the Biſhops and Prieſts who Inſtructed them in their Religion, and the Deacons who aſſiſted them; as alſo to Deliver up the Holy Scriptures. Twas in the <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cletian</hi> Perſecution, that the Heathens were more particularly bent upon deſtroying the Books of the Chriſtians, looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that as the moſt Effectual means of deſtroying their Religion it ſelf. They ſought after them with the utmoſt Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and burned all they could Seize. <note place="margin">Acta. C. tens. an. 303.</note> They ſearched the Churches for them, the Lodgings of the Readers, and all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſes. Upon all theſe Queries the <note place="margin">Acta Mar. Alutin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud Bar. An. 303. n. 35, &amp;c.</note> Chriſtians kept their ſecrets as Inviolable
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57456:66"/> as they did their Myſteries. They never <note place="margin">Acta S S. Agapes &amp;c apud Bar. an. 304. n. 40, &amp;c.</note> named any Man's Perſon; they anſwered that they were Taught of God, they were aſſiſted of God, they carryed the Holy Scriptures engraven on their Hearts. They who were ſo Cowardly to Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up their Bibles, or Diſcover their Brethren or their Prieſts, were Branded with the Odious name of Traitors, If the Martyrs under their Torments uttered any Words at all, they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were upon any other Subject than that of Glorifying the goodneſs of God and Imploring his Mercy and Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>AFTER this cruel Examination they <note place="margin">XVII. Priſons,</note> who ſtill perſiſted in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, were dilivered over to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; but they were often remand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Priſon, to be kept yet longer upon trial of their Patience, and reſerved for freſh Torments; and indeed, the Priſons themſelves were but another ſort of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe Confeſſors of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were thrown into the Darkeſt and moſt Infectious Dungeons, their Hands and Feet loaded with Irons, heavy clogs of Wood hanging upon their Necks, or Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with croſs Bolts, contrived ſo as either to keep them ſtanding, or their legs diſtended if they lay. Sometimes they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57456:66"/> ſtrewed the Dungeon with little pieces of Pot-ſherds or broken Glaſs; and there <note place="margin">Prudent PaeriSteph. 4 de S. Vin. &amp; al.</note> they forced them to lye Naked, all full of Cuts and Wounds. Sometimes they left their Wounds to feſter and putrify upon <note place="margin">Mart. xvi. April. de S Encratide.</note> them, and in that condition ſuffered them to dye, with Hunger and Thirſt. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they carefully fed and tended them but only to keep them in Heart for freſh Torments. They were generally denied the liberty of ſpeaking one Word to any Perſon living; it having been found by experience, That under that Condition they had Converted many of the Infidels, even to the very Goalers and Soldiers themſelves that guarded them. Sometimes they ordered to be brought unto them <note place="margin">Act. SS. Perpet. &amp; Felic.</note> ſuch Perſons as they thought moſt likely to ſhake their Conſtancy; as their Fathers, their Mothers, their Wives, their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; whoſe Tears and melting Diſcourſes were another ſort of Temptation; and many times of more dangerous Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than their Torments. If a Martyr <note place="margin">Martyr. 31. Aug.</note> were with Child they deferred her Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till ſhe was Delivered; for ſo the Law required.

If they were denied entrance, they freely gave large Bribes to the Keepers and Soldiers to gain Acceſs; nor would they be repulſed by their rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. They ſubmitted to Blows and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies, put up all Affronts and Injuries, patiently waited at the Priſon Doors whole Nights together, in hopes of gaining the favourable Minute of ſatisfying their Charity. Whenever they could gain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, they looked upon the Priſon as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v Cypr. Ep.</hi> v. <hi>and</hi> vi.</note> a Church, Conſecrated by the preſence of the Saints; there they made their Prayers, and thither the Prieſts reſorted to Celebrate the Sacrifice, and afford the Confeſſors the bleſſed Conſolation of not going out of the World without the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. But if it were a Biſhop or Prieſt
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57456:67"/> that was in Priſon, the Faithful there Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelves together, that they might not loſe the Opportunity of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Euchariſt, and carrying it home with them to their Houſes; and in ſuch Caſes as theſe, they made uſe of any means they could. Sometimes the Prieſts for want of Altars, made the Conſecration upon the hands of the Deacons; and that Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Martyr St. <hi>Lucian</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> being ſo ſtaked down that he could not ſtir, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acta apud Bar. anno</hi> 311.</note> made the Conſecration on his own Breaſt. One may well imagin with what force of Exhortation theſe Adminiſtrations were attended. All the Church look'd upon theſe holy Priſoners as it were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Crowned in Heaven. They had a great influence upon the Prelates to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain favour on the behalf of thoſe whoſe weakneſs had betrayed them into Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; inſomuch, that it was found neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to preſcribe ſome Cautions and Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <note place="margin">

They cauſed him to continue in Prayer for a long time together, either kneeling upon his Knees, or lying flat upon the Ground: To watch, to lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bare Ground, to give Alms accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Abillity. During the time of his Pennance, he was to abſtaine not only from all Recreations, but alſo from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Converſation to keep no Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, meddle with no Buſineſs, nor have any
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57456:71"/> communication ſomuch as with the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful themſelves, except in Caſes of great Neceſſity.

The time of Pennance was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways long, at leaſt, unleſs there were ſome ſpecial Reaſon for the ſhortning of it; as the Extraordinary fervour of the Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, a mortal Diſtemper, or preſent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: <note place="margin">

               <p>If the Penitent during the time of his Pennance, committed any new Crime, he was obliged to begin his Pennance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. If they ſaw his Puniſhment did no
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57456:72"/> good upon him, nor produced any change in his Life, they let him continue in that State; not admitting him to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and if after having received Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, he relapſed into any hanious Sin, there were no more Sacraments for him: <note place="margin">S. <hi>August.

There were ſome Sins, for which, the Pennance how ſincerely and fully ſoever performed, was to continue one's whole Life time; after the Commiſſion of which the Communion was never to be given, but upon the point of Death. Apoſtates <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cypr ep.</hi> liii. <hi>ad Anton. Conc.

They who had been once placed among the Penitents, though Abſolved and Reconciled; yet could never after that be capable of receiving holy Orders, or of being advanced to any Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Miniſtry. And if a Prieſt or any
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57456:73"/> Clerk had committed a Sin deſerving publick Pennance; he only loſt his ſtation in the Church; that is, he was for ever after Interdicted the Exerciſe of his Function, and reduced to the ſtate of a ſimple Laick. But that they might not <note place="margin">

               <p>If any one ſhall wonder at this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Ancients, let him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Sins to which Pennance was due, were in thoſe Days rarely known among Chriſtians; for as with us, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Honour, who are well Educated and ſetled in the World, ſeldom fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe Crimes which bring them ſo far under the laſh of the Law, as to make them liable to the infamy of Publick Puniſhments; ſo of old, it did not often happen that Chriſtians ſo carefully admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo well inſtructed, ſhould be guilty of Adultery, Homicide, or other ſuch like hanious Sins which deſerved Death. <hi>Tertullian</hi> declares that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks were eaſily diſtinguiſhed from <note place="margin">

Therefore in their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they always preferred Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Infidels; and among Chriſtians, thoſe that were moſt remarkable for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue were taken care of firſt; but as for the incorrigible, they left them to ſhift for themſelves.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57456:78"/> were rarely frequented by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of any Faſhion or Quality.

               <p>'Tis no wonder then that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould be ſo forward in Exerciſing Hoſpitality, who lookd upon themſelves as Friends and Brothers to one another; and who knew that Jeſus Chriſt had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended Hoſpitality, as one of the <note place="margin">

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57456:79"/> that ſhould have ſhut his Doors againſt ſuch an One, would have been thought to have ſhut out Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. But firſt they Expected that he ſhould make himſelf fully known. To that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe that Travailed, took with them Letters from their Biſhop: And <note place="margin">V.

               <p>The firſt Act of Hoſpitality was to waſh the Feet of their Gueſts. Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of which we meet with often in Scripture. And this was but a neceſſary <note place="margin">

They counted themſelves Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in having his Company, and looked upon their Meat as in ſome ſort Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by his taking part with them. The Clergy were every where Honoured pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the Station they held in the Church.

               <p>The Chriſtians proceeding upon other Principles, looked upon Death only as an Entrance upon Eternity. So that leading good Lives, as moſt of them did, they ſaw cauſe rather to wiſh for Death than to Dread it; and the preſent loſs of their Friends or Relations, was the leſs afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the hopes of their Happineſs; and the expectation of ſeeing them in Heaven, made their Satisfacton excel their Grief.

               <p>Theſe <hi>Catacombs</hi> were places under Ground, cut out of Quarries of ſoft and brittle Stone, or hollowed out of the Beds of Sand; thus contrived by the Chriſtians for their Burying Places: There are wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Staires leading down to them, and long Walks or Streets which have on each ſide of them, cut into the Earth two or three rows of deep Nitches, in which the Bodies were placed at <hi>firſt;</hi> for <hi>now</hi> the greateſt part of them are taken away. At certain diſtances from each other, are ſpacious Chambers, vaulted over and Solid as the reſt, having alſo Nitches cut in them like thoſe of the Walks. The greateſt part of theſe Chambers are paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with divers Hiſtories of the old and new Teſtament; as their Churches alſo were wont to be. And in ſome of theſe Caemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, there are Subterranean Churches: In many of them there have been found Marble Coffins, adorned with Figures of <hi>Baſs Relief,</hi> repreſenting the ſame Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories as the Paintings do. Theſe were the Sepulchres of the moſt conſiderable Perſons; every one of theſe Caemiteries is like a City under Ground, and ſome of them two or three Stories deep: In them the Chriſtians found a place of retreat during the Perſecutions; there they kept the Reliques of the Martyrs; there they met and Celebrated the holy Offices; nay,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57456:83"/> and there ſome of them conſtantly reſided, as is written of many of the Popes. The Book called <hi>Roma Subterranea,</hi> is a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe ancient Caemiteries: They remained the greateſt part of them, for a long time unknown; the entrance into them having been ſtopped up; and 'twas but about the end of the laſt Century that they were diſcovered.

               <p>TO finiſh the Character of theſe firſt <note place="margin">XXV. Their Biſhops, Prieſts, &amp; Clerks.</note> Times, I muſt neceſſarily add a Word or two concerning the Paſtors and Miniſters of the Church. <hi>Origen</hi> making the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon

                  <hi>Eccleſias</hi> with the Chriſtian Churches, openly Avers it as a thing undeniable, That thoſe who preſide over the Chriſtian Churches, had in reality that Eminency of worth and Vertue above others, which the Magiſtrates of Cities had only in Name and ſhew; and this he ſpeaks in his Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> where he had ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly expoſed himſelf to the Heathens had not the thing been manifeſtly So. 'Tis indeed plain Matter of Fact: The one and thirty Popes who filled up the three firſt Ages, were all but two of them Martyrs; and during the ſix Ages follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ninth Century, there are not above three or four of them whom the Church hath not acknowledged for Saints. Moſt of the Biſhops mentioned in Hiſtory for the three firſt Ages, ſtand upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord for ſingular Examples of Vertue and Piety; ſo that the Emperor <hi>Alexander Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lamprid in Alex.</note> propoſes the Chriſtians Method of chuſing their Clergy as an Example of the Care which ought to be taken of enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Manners and Qualifications of all Perſons to be admitted into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Employments.

               <p>The Biſhop often choſe his Clerks at the inſtance of the People, at leaſt not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Knowledge, and always with the advice of his Clergy. But whether the Perſons themſelves to be Ordained were deſirous of it or not; that they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded.

The Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination was followed by the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop ordained no more Prieſts, Deacons, or other Clerks, then juſt ſo many as were neceſſary for the Service of his Church; that is to ſay, for all his Dioceſs. This number was not great, ſince in the time of the Pope St. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euſeb.</hi> vi. <hi>Hist. c.</hi> 43.</note> 
                  <hi>Anno Chriſti</hi> 250, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had but forty ſix Prieſts, and but one hundred fity four Clergy of all ſorts; though the People belonging to it were vaſtly numerous. The Biſhops were <note place="margin">Lib. Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical.</note> much more numerous in Proportion; every City that had any conſiderable number of Chriſtians in it, had alſo its Biſhop. Hence it is, that in the Lives of the firſt Popes, we find more Biſhops or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57456:85"/> by them than Prieſts: They or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Prieſts only for their own Dioceſs, but made Biſhops for the greateſt part of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Clergy depended entirely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Biſhop, living under his direction in the nature of Diſciples; and 'twas his buſineſs to inſtruct and Diſcipline them; to advance them from one Degree to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and allot to every one their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Functions, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Talents he found in them.

                  </note> St. <hi>Blaeſus,</hi> and with ſome other Saints, were manifeſtly ſome of thoſe which were breeding up for holy Orders.

               <p>Yet this Authority of the Biſhops over their Clergy was no Arbritrary and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potick <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 3.</note> Power, but a Government mixed with Love. The Eccleſiaſticks ſhared ſome part of the Authority with the Biſhop, ſince he did nothing of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance without their Advice: The Prieſts eſpecially were conſulted with, who made as it were the Churche's Senate. The Prieſts were ſo Venerable and the Biſhops ſo Humble, that to common appearance
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57456:85"/> there was but little difference between them. Nay the Clergy had ſome kind of Authority over the Biſhop himſelf, being the continual Inſpectors both of his Life and Doctrine. They attended on <note place="margin">

For the Clerks were to the Biſhops as the Apoſtles to Jeſus Chriſt, his conſtant Attendants. If therefore any Biſhop ſhould have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed either to Teach or Practiſe any thing contrary to Apoſtolical Tradition; the more elderly of the Prieſts and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons would preſently have Remonſtrated againſt it. They would firſt in a Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manner have Advertiſed him of his Error; if that took no effect, they would have made their complaints againſt him to the other Biſhops, or at laſt have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed him before a Council.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the Clergy led the <hi>Aſcetique</hi> Life, feeding onely on Pulſe or dry Dyets; Faſting often, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing other ſuch like Auſterities as far as the great Labours of their Callings would admit of. Above all Continence was in a more eſpecial manner required of Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, Prieſts, and Deacons. Not but that Marryed Perſons were often advanced to theſe Orders; For how could they have found amonſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57456:86"/> that were Dayly Converted to Chriſtianity any conſiderable number of Perſons that had preſerved an abſolute Continence to their advanced Years. It was much to find thoſe that had confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 2.</note> themſelves only to one Wife, in that liberty which the <hi>Jews</hi> and other Eaſtern People took, of having many Wives at once, and the cuſtom of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce Univerſally admitted, which put them often upon changing their Wives. But when a Marryed Perſon was made a Biſhop, he began from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to look upon his Wife only as his Siſter: And to the ſame Rule hath the <note place="margin">

As for the Inferior Clerks, as Readers and Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, they were commonly Marryed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57456:86"/> Perſons, and Cohabited with their Wives. So that a great part of them paſſed their whole Lives in theſe lower Orders, at leaſt they continued in them for many Years, till they either loſt their Wives, or elſe by mutual Conſent, they agreed to Separate from each other, in order to the leading a more perfect Life: Yet was Marriage always ſpoken of by Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians as an Honourable State: And that the rather, becauſe there were ſome He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks who profeſſed an Abhorrence of it, and others who Abſolutely condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all ſecond Marriages as Unlawful.</p>
               <p>All the Clergy even to the Biſhops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Lived after a Poor, at leaſt a Plain and Ordinary manner; having no thing as to outward appearance to Diſtinguiſh them from the common People. In the Perſecutions, as they were the Perſons, the moſt ſought after, they had no mind to make themſelves known by their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit or any other marke of their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If in any thing they Differed from the common People, twas in appearing more like the Philoſophers. Many of them had parted with all their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Poſſeſſions to the Poor, before their being advanced to Holy Orders; and many of them again after their Ordination ſtill continued, like St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to Live by the Labour of their Hands.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57456:87"/> Not that they were obliged ſo to do. The Church always took care of her Clergy, ſupplying them with all Neceſſaries out <note place="margin">S. Cypr. <hi>Ep.</hi> xxxiv.</note> of her common Treaſure. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, every Clerk received either Week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Monthly, a certain Diſtribution, either in Money or of Proviſions in <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> anſwerable to the Exigencies of their Condition, or the Quality of their Office. For the Clerks of an higher Station, and conſequently charged with greater La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, received (according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of St. <hi>Paul)</hi> more liberal Allowances. <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> v. 17.</note> Some there were alſo that kept their own temporal Eſtate, together with their Spiritual Dignity.

But ſuch Diſputes could not often happen among Chriſtians ſo Diſintereſſed, ſo Humble, and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as they were. <hi>Munday</hi> was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the Day which the Biſhop took to determine Differences; ſo that if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhould not readily Acquieſſe in the Sentence, they might yet have time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them to Moderate matters and bring them to a Right underſtanding before the Sunday following; when they were all to meet again in the Church, and Pray and Communicate together. On the Day of Hearing, the Biſhop ſeated in his Chair, the Prieſts ſitting down by him, and the Deacons attending; the Parties Preſented themſelves before him, reſpectfully ſtanding on their Legs, in the midſt of the place of Audience. After having heard the Cauſe, he firſt did all that was poſſible to Reconcile
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57456:88"/> them each other, and to perſwade them to make up the Difference in a Friendly manner between themſelves before he pronounced Sentence. At the ſame time alſo they heard Complaints and received Informations againſt Perſons accuſed of not leading their Lives like Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop was fully entruſted with <note place="margin">

The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, &amp; Patience of the Chriſtians.</note> Lived during the times of Paganiſm and Perſecution. This condition obliged them for the moſt part to great Circumſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to be always waiting upon God, and watching over themſelves. For when once the Perſecution began, a Man had nothing elſe to expect but to be the next hour Impeached, even by his own Wife, or by his neareſt Relation; who either out of Covetouſneſs to get his Eſtate, or out of a bigotted Zeal for their Idolatries, might be prompted to Betray them. This <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Martyr.</hi> xxx. <hi>Jul de S.</hi> Julitea.</note> was a ready way for Debtors to get rid of their Creditors; or Slaves, of their Maſters. If a Pagan fell in Love with the Daughter of a Chriſtian, he either put her upon the ſad neceſſity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance or of expoſing her ſelf to Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. St. <hi>Juſtin</hi> gives us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a Wife that was informed a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt, <note place="margin">

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57456:89"/> that Woman) Barely upon the name of a Chriſtian, without any other Accuſation, ſomuch as pretended againſt him. Though the Church had its ſhort Intervals of Peace, yet they were always in expectation of the War breaking out again. Nor was the Peace ever ſo enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; but that in the moſt Quiet times, many Chriſtians ſuffered either by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Commotions or other means. For we find a great number of Martyrs even under the Emperors who would not be ingaged in Perſecuting the Church. St. <hi>Melito</hi> complains to the Emperor <hi>Antonine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ap. Euſeb. 4.

Or if they did enjoy ſome little Reſpite from Perſecution, and open Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, yet they ſtill were expoſed to the utmoſt contempt and Hatred. Every one had the liberty of Speaking againſt the Chriſtians, whatever he pleaſed, True or Falſe; of Diſcourſing and Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them, of Ridiculing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them and their Religion, upon the open Theatre. All this was not only Connived at, but Authoriſed and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. And the paſſages of <hi>Celſus</hi> quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Origen,</hi> are ſufficient proofs, with what Scorn they were Treated. They
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57456:90"/> could not avoid ſeeing the profane Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the <hi>Pagans</hi> every Day, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where ever they went, with their Infamous Statues and publick Places of Debauchery; having their Ears filled with their Lewd and Impious Diſcourſes. The Chriſtians of theſe times muſt of neceſſity have had a more then ordinary Strength, and firmneſs of Mind, in the Midſt of ſo many Difficulties and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to keep up their Faith and Practice ſo lively and Unexceptionable.</p>
               <p>It required alſo agreat Diſcretion to Moderate themſelves, and to keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in due Bounds, that liberty of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and that Boldneſs of Spirit <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ii. 16.</note> which ariſes from the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience. They knew how to Contemn, Contempt unjuſtly caſt upon them, to bear the moſt Injurious Calumnies without quarreling; thoſe that aſperſed them without either hatred or Complaint. They were very cautious of doing any thing that might draw Perſecution upon them. They <note place="margin">

To this End they found it neceſſary to refrain from all things, (the Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable Duties of their Religion Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) which might give occaſion of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57456:90"/> Offence to the Heathens, or Provoke their Diſpleaſure; and on the contrary, to ſtudy all Honeſt means of obliging them. The Neceſſary Practices of a Chriſtian Life, did ſufficiently Diſtinguiſh them from the reſt of the World, without their Affecting any Superfluous Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities. So that as to their outward Form of Living, in all things not contrary to Piety and good manners, they conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the Cuſtoms and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Greeks,</hi> or the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the other Countrys, where they Lived. They never forced themſelves upon Diſputing or Preaching to thoſe whom they found not Diſpoſed to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them. They contented themſelves with Praying for them, and ſtrove to Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fye them by the Example of their Patience <note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Rom.</note> and good Works; never ceaſing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Good for Evil.

               <p>But more remarkable was their Patience towards their Princes, Magiſtrates, and the ſecular Authority: They were never heard complaning againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor ever ſpake contemptuouſly of the Civil Power. They gave them all the honour and obedience they could on this ſide Idolatry; they paid their Tributes not only without reſiſting, but without repin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and rather then defraud them of their Rights, if they had not otherwiſe to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; they made it up out of the labour of their Hands.</p>
               <p>So far were they from raiſing Sedition <note place="margin">

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57456:91"/> ever found to have had an Hand in any of them; tho' the Emperors were never ſo bad, and the Perſecutors never ſo cruel. The Chriſtians were the only Perſons who did not make it their buſineſs to get rid of <hi>Nero, Domitian, Commodus, Caracalla</hi> and ſo many other Tyrants; Oppreſt, and Harraſſed as they were with all ſorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and groaning under the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Cruelties: Yet it never entered into their Thoughts to reſiſt the Powers, or to take up Arms in their own Defence, though they were numerous enough to have made up a greater Body of Men, than any of the Nations could, that made War againſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> Nay, more than that of ſo many Chriſtian Soldiers, with which the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies were filled; none ever made uſe of the Sword they had in their Hands, but to Execute the Orders of their Prince or their Commanders; and we read of entire Legions, (as that of St. <hi>Mauritius)</hi> that without the leſt reſiſtance ſuffered themſelves to be cut to pieces, rather than to fail of doing their Duty either to God or <hi>Caeſar.</hi>

               <p>After all theſe Preparations, they were at laſt ſolemnly Baptized; either on <hi>Eaſter-Eve,</hi> to put them in mind of riſing up with Chriſt to newneſs of Life: or on the Eve of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> that they might then with the Apoſtles receive the Gift of the Holy-Ghoſt: For at the ſame time that they received Baptiſm, they had Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation alſo. Baptiſm was regularly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred only upon thoſe two Feaſts; but in caſe of danger, they Baptized at any time. The new Baptized, of what Age ſoever they were, were called by the name of Children. They wore during the whole firſt Week the white Robe they had received at their Baptiſm, in token of the Innocence wherein they were to walk all the Days of their Life: Nor might <note place="margin">

The Churches were now in all places frequented more than ever: The <hi>Pſalmody,</hi> the Celebration of the Myſteries, and all the Ceremonies of Religion were performed with greater
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57456:95"/> Solemnity then ever: So that this is the proper place to ſpeak of their outward form of Worſhip.

               <p>THE Church was ſeparated as much <note place="margin">XXVIII The form of the Churches &amp; their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments.</note> as poſſibly they could, from all profane Buildings, and placed at a diſtance from noiſe; ſurrouuded on every ſide with Courts, Gardens, or Buildings belonging to the Church.

At the farther end of this Court, was a double Porch; and through it there was a paſſage by three Doors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hall or <hi>Baſilique,</hi> which was the Body of the Church. I call it Double, becauſe there was one without, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57456:96"/> within, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> called the <hi>Narthex.</hi> Near the Baſilique on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, were generally two Buildings; the Baptiſtery at the Entry; and at the other end the <hi>Sacriſtry</hi> or Treaſury, called alſo <note place="margin">Cellae.</note> the <hi>Secretarium</hi> or <hi>Diaconium.</hi> Along the ſides of the Church, were often placed <note place="margin">Exhedrae.</note> little Chambers or Cells, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of them that had a mind to retire, and meditate or Pray by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: So that they were in effect, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little Chappels.</p>
               <p>The Baſilique or Church was Parted into three Diviſions, proportionable to its Largeneſs, by two rows of Pillars ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Galleries on each ſide, and the Middle between theſe Galleries was the <hi>Nave,</hi> as we ſee it in all Old Churches. Toward the Eaſt end was the <hi>Altar;</hi> and behind that, the Presbytery or Sanctuary, where the Prieſts ſat in time of Divine Service, with their Biſhop in the Middle of them, whoſe Chair was at the very end of the Baſilique, and terminated the proſpect of them that came in at the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Door. There was before the Altar, a Partition encloſed within Balaſters, which we may call the <hi>Choir</hi> or <hi>Chancel;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cancelli.</note> and in the Middle of the Entrance into it, ſtood the <hi>Pulpit</hi> or <hi>Ambo</hi> for the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the publick leſſons; which was a kind of Tribunal Seat, Erected on high
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57456:96"/> above the reſt of the Congregation, and had a pair of By-Staires on each ſide. Sometimes they made two of theſe Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deſer. S.</hi> Mar. <hi>Mai.</hi>
                  </note> over againſt one another, with a little void Space between them, ſo as to leave the Middle open, that the Altar might not be out of Sight. On the right Hand of the Biſhop and the left of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtood the <hi>Desk</hi> for the Goſpel; and on the other ſide, that for the Epiſtle. Behind the Pulpit, up to the Altar, was the place for the Singing Men; who were Clerks alſo, but Ordained only to this Office.</p>
               <p>The Altar was a rich Table of Gold or Silver, Ornamented with precious Stones. It was at worſt of Marble or Porphyry, for they thought they could never em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy matter good enough for the bearing of the Holy of Holies; and the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies they uſed in the Conſecration of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, ſufficiently declare in what Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they held them. The Holy Table was always kept uncovered, but at the time of the Sacrifice. It ſtood upon four Feet, or little Pillars as rich in proportion as the Table its ſelf, and it was Placed, if poſſible, over the Grave of ſome Martyr. For as they had been formerly accuſtomed to meet at their Tombs, ſo now they built their Churches there, or elſe Tranſlated their Bodies to the Places where they built them: And thence it came to be a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57456:97"/> Rule, never to Conſecrate an Altar without putting Reliques under it. And theſe Tombs of the Saints they called <hi>Memoriae</hi> or Confeſſions. They were layd under Ground, and there was a way <note place="margin">Baron. in Martyr. 6. Jul.</note> down to them, opening before the Altar, which ſtood directly over them. There was nothing ſtanding inmediately upon the Altar it ſelf, but it was ſurrounded with four Pillars at the four corners of it, Supporting a kind of Tabernacle, that covered the whole Compaſs of the Altar, and was called the <hi>Cupelo</hi> from its reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in figure a <hi>Cup revers't.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behind the Altar (as I ſaid before) was the place for the Prieſts. And here the roof was built lower than the reſt of the Church, and was called the <hi>Concha,</hi> as being in the form of a <hi>Scallop-ſhell,</hi> or the <hi>Abſis</hi> from the Arch, with which the Front of it was Terminated. This end of the Church was alſo called the Tribunal, becauſe in the Heathen Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces it was the place where the Magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, with his Officers about him ſat in Judicature. This part of the Church was raiſed ſomewhat higher than the reſt, ſo that the Biſhop came down ſome <note place="margin">Ordo Rom.</note> ſteps from thence to the Altar.</p>
               <p>All this was ſet off with Magnificent Ornaments. The Cupelo, and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that ſuſteined it, were often all of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57456:97"/> Silver; ſome of them weighed three <note place="margin">Anast. in Silveſt. &amp; in Leone iii. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Id. in Steph. iv.</note> thouſand Marks. Between theſe Pillars hung Curtains of the Richeſt Stuffe, drawn on all ſides to keep the Altar from being ſeen. The Cupelo was adorned with ſeveral Images and other pieces of Art wrought in Gold or Silver, and the top of it was made in Reſemblance of the Croſs. There were hanging alſo over the Altar, Gold or Silver Doves, to <note place="margin">Conc. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin. an. 536. Act. v.</note> Repreſent the Holy Ghoſt: Here ſome times they laid up the Euchariſt for the Sick, and ſometimes kept it in plain Boxes like our <hi>Pixes.</hi> Sometimes the whole <hi>Abſis</hi> was all overlaid with Silver, or at leaſt faced with Marble, as was alſo the Concha. The Pillars that Supported the Church were of Marble, with Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of Braſs guilt with Gold. It was Paved with Marble, and many times the inſide of the Walls was Rough caſt with poliſhed Stones.</p>
               <p>They moſt affected in their Churches (eſpecially in the following Ages) the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick-work,</hi>

                  </note> placed ſome Reliques: And that's the Reaſon why the faithful always expreſſed ſome particular marks of reſpect upon their entering in at the Doors of the Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Diaconicum,</hi> or <hi>Sacriſty</hi> was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable building adjoining to the Church. It was the Repoſitory for the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Veſſels; the Books, the Habits of the Prieſts, and the other choiceſt Furniture of the Church. The Oblations of the faithful were alſo kept there, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the Euchariſt. There it was that the Biſhop and his Clergy uſually met to conſult together about the affairs of the Church, or to prepare themſelves for the Sacrifice. As it was St. <hi>Martin's</hi> Cuſtom <note place="margin">Sever. de vita S. Mart.</note> to paſs three Hours in praying by himſelf in the Sacriſty before Maſs. And from this uſe of it, we find it took the name of <hi>Secretarium:</hi> Some of them were ſo <note place="margin">Conc. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag. Con.

In ſome Churches there
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57456:99"/> were two different Apartments for theſe <note place="margin">Paul. ep. xii.</note> two ſeveral uſes, one to lock up the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Veſſels in, and the other for the Miniſters to retire into and meditate there or to meet together and Conſult.</p>
               <p>They had a great number of <hi>Calices</hi> and <hi>Patins,</hi> which in the firſt times were often of no better Materials than Glaſs; but ſometimes alſo of Silver or Gold, even during the Perſecutions. Their <hi>Calices</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib.

The <hi>Calices</hi> of the Church were generally of about the weight of three <note n="*" place="margin">A Mark weighs 8 Ounces.</note> Marks, but their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins</hi> were large deep Diſhes weighing ſome of them forty five Marks, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly about thirty: 'Twas in theſe times that they brought into the Church the uſe of Wax Tapers, great numbers of 'em always kept burning together, and that <note place="margin">V.

We find that there were in the Primitive times Golden Candleſticks of thirty ſeven Marks weight a peice, and Silver ones of forty five given to ſome Churches: And in the Provinces we find alſo mention made of perfumed Tapers, as at the Baptiſm of <hi>Clovis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Baptiſtery was generally built in <note place="margin">Anaſtas in Sylveſtr. Greg. Tur. lib. ii.</note> a round form, having within it a place ſunk into the Ground (after the manner of a Well) with ſome ſteps down to the Water: For indeed it was properly a Bath.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin. an. 535.</note> the name of the <hi>Jordan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much after this manner (generally Speaking) did the Ancients Contrive their Churches, and the buildings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them; not to ſpeak here of the Biſhops Houſe and the Lodgings for his Clergy, whence came in after Ages the Cloiſters of the Cannons; nor to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Hoſpitals of divers ſorts, which were commonly ſeated near the principal Church.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for having neither Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, nor Altars, nor Images, nor Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, nor Feaſts. To which the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians <note place="margin">Orig. in Cels. lib. viii.</note> made no other anſwer, but that neither Temples, nor material Altars, nor Bloody Sacrifices were worthy of the Majeſty of God: That God could have no other Image but his own Son, and reaſonable Souls, who by Imitating the Son rendred themſelves like unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57456:100"/> That they did at all times, and in all places offer up to God the Sacrifice of Praiſe, upon the Altars of their Hearts; burning with the fire of Charity. In fine that the true Chriſtians do keep every Day a Feaſt, by their diſengagement from the Affairs of this World; by the reſt of a good Conſcience, and their Rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the hope of Heaven. This was the Defence the Chriſtians made for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the reproaches of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. They did not pretend to ſay, we have Temples and Altars as well as you, though not of the ſame form and Figure.</p>
               <p>To have ſaid ſo, would have given the Heathens quite different Conceptions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Religion, from what it is in Reality. An Altar with them, was a Fire-hearth of Stone Erected either before ſome Idol or before ſome Temple, but always in the open Air, deſigned for the Burning of their Victims, and to pour Wine, Milk, Hony or other ſort of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations upon it. A Temple was a round or oblong Building, where the Bigneſs, Figure and Proportion were particular according to the different Divinities to which they were Conſecrated; as one may ſee in <hi>Vitruvius.</hi> They were for <note place="margin">Vitruv.</note> the moſt part of ſmall Extent, made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Windows, or at leaſt admitting little Light; nor did they contain any thing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57456:101"/> in them, but the Idols and things offered to them. The People never entered them, but remained without Surrounding the Altar.</p>
               <p>Our Churches were more like the publick Schools, or Town-Halls deſigned for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which the Ancients called <hi>Baſilicae;</hi>

                  </note> and the Deſcription of them is alſo given us by <hi>Vitruvius.</hi> They ſaw in our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es a Tribunal raiſed up on High, with a <hi>Chair</hi> for him that Preſided in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, a Desk for the Reader, Benches for the Auditors; Books, Preſſes, Lamps and Candleſticks; and amongſt other things a <hi>Table,</hi> the uſe of which, they that were Strangers to our Religion could not tell what to make of; only conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general, that it was for taking ſome kind of Repaſt upon among our ſelves. The Chriſtians did not agree in the ſame Names with the Heathens. They gave to the places of their publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the Name of <hi>Eccleſia, Baſilica, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorie, Martyriam, Titulus,</hi> the Houſe of God, or the Houſe of the Lord; they rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of the name of <hi>Temple,</hi> and never (within the Compas of my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) of <hi>Delubrum</hi> or <hi>Fanum.</hi> The names of Particular Churches were often taken from their Founders, as at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus Paſtoris,</hi> the <hi>Baſilica</hi> of <hi>Liberius</hi> or <hi>Sixtus,</hi> which is now St. <hi>Mary</hi> the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57456:101"/> great; or from the Ancient Name of the Houſe, as <hi>Baſilica Laterana.</hi> Afterwards they came alſo to make uſe of Churches built by the Heathens; when they found them fit for the uſe of Religion. So in <hi>Rome</hi> they Converted the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Minerva,</hi> of <hi>Fortuna Virilis</hi> with ſome others into Chriſtian Churches.</p>

Nepot.</note> gives a ſpecial Commendation of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potian</hi> the Prieſt, for the care he took of, keeping his Church in good order: The Walls dry and free from Smut and Mould; the Pavements rubbed, the <hi>Sacriſty</hi> clean, the Veſſels ſhining, the Door-keeper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon his Office. This was the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines of the inferior Officers, under what Name ſoever they went, as <hi>Door-keepers, Manſionaries, Camerarii, Sacriſtans;</hi> and <note place="margin">Cubiculari Aeditui.</note> there was a great number of theſe Officers in the larger Churches.

It was their buſineſs to open the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57456:102"/> Church Doors at the uſual time, and to ſtand at them upon their Duty, to keep Infidels or Excommunicated Perſons from Entring. They kept the Keys, and took care that nothing was loſt. We find in <note place="margin">

'Twas theſe Inferior Officers that Dres't up the Church againſt the more ſolemn Feſtivals, either with Silk Tapeſteries or other rich Hangings, or only with Boughs and Flowers. In a Word, they were to do every thing that was neceſſary to keep the Holy Place fit for making Impreſſions of Reverence and Piety upon thoſe who approached it. All theſe Functions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared too Conſiderable to be permitted to pure Laicks. So that 'twas thought neceſſary to Eſtabliſh theſe new Orders of Minor Clerks on purpoſe to eaſe the Deacons, and to take off ſome part of their Charge.</p>
               <p>THOUGH t'is true, the Chriſtian <note place="margin">XXIX. Devotion aſſiſted by Senſe.</note> Religion is altogether Inward and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; yet Chriſtians are Men as well as others, and therefore not above the power of Sence and Imagination. Nay, we may ſay that the greateſt part of Man-kind ſcarce Act or Live upon any other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. How few apply themſelves to Operations purely Intellectual; and they
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57456:102"/> that do ſo, find their thoughts eaſyly Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from Spiritual Objects. Devotion therefore muſt be aſſiſted by the Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Senſe. Were we Angels, we might Pray in all places alike, in the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Roads, in the Crowd of the Streets, in the Noiſe of the Guard-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in the Roaring and Riots of a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern; over the Stenches of a Common-Shore. Why then do we ſhun theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Diſtraction; and when we would be Devout, ſeek after Silence and retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but only as a Remedy againſt the Impotence of Senſe and Imagination? 'Tis not God that hath need of <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Oratories,</hi> but We. He is equally preſent in all Places, and always equally ready to hear us everywhere, but we are not always in a frame of Spirit fit to Speak to him. So that 'tis a needleſs and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs peice of Work to Conſecrate parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places to his Service, unleſs they be alſo put into a Condition proper to aſſiſt our Devotion.</p>
               <p>Let us Suppoſe for Example, that which we ſee too often in theſe later Times, a Church ſo ill Scituated, that it Ecchoes with the Noiſes of an Adjacent Street or a Neighbouring Market; and ſo naſtily kept that one can ſcarce ſit down or kneel in it for Dirt; ſuppoſe it thron'd with ſuch a Herd of People promiſcuouſly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57456:103"/> crowded together, that, they who attend upon Prayer, are every Moment juſtled and trampled upon by others puſhing on their way through them, and continually inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with Children's Crying or Playing, Loud Beggars Bawling about their Ears: Add to this, that you have nothing before your Eyes but diſagreable Objects, the Walls covered over with a filthy Smut and Mouldineſs, the Pictures disfigur'd with Duſt and Cobwebbs, and placed in an ill Light; the ſtatues of a deformed Make, or half of them broken off, and the other Ornaments in as ill a condition. In fine, to omit nothing offenſive to ſenſe; for Incenſe an horrid fume of ſtinking Vapours; and for Muſick, a multitude of untuned Voices jumbled together in Croaking Sounds: It will be much eaſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a Man to Pray in an open Field, or in a lone uninhabited Houſe then in ſuch a Church as this. On the contrary, let a Man go into a Church well built, beautifully adorned, and neatly Kept; where all things are ſtill and quiet, the People well placed, and the Clergy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Office in a regular manner, and with a becoming Reverence and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; he will find himſelf inſenſibly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to attend the Service he is upon with a compoſedneſs of Thought, and be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57456:103"/> able to Pray with the Heart at the ſame <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 14.</note> time he ſpeaks with his Lips.</p>
               <p>Of this the Biſhops of the Firſt Ages were very ſenſible. Thoſe Holy Perſons were either <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans,</hi> many of them great Philoſophers, all of them train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ep up in the niceſt obſervance of all the Rules of Decency. They knew that the order, Grandeur and agreeableneſs of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Objects, have a natural Efficacy in them of exciting in the mind Noble, pure, and well regulated Thoughts; and that the Affections follow thoſe Thoughts: But that 'tis next to impoſſible to keep the Soul Intent upon that which is good, while the Body is uneaſy or the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſobliged: They thought Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a matter of that Importance that it required all the aſſiſtance which could handſomly be given it; and therefore took care to have the publick Services of the Church, eſpecially that of the Sacrifice, Celebrated with all poſſible Majeſty, and the People aſſiſting at it, accommodated with all imaginable Conveniencies, that ſo they might be brought on to take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Houſe of Prayer and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it with Reverence. And they were at the ſame time ſufficiently Cautions alſo to keep out of the Holy Places, all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances of a Worldly Pomp; all the appearances of a wanton Vanity, or
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57456:104"/> whatſoever might have a tendency to Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate the mind or ſtrike the Senſes with dangerous Impreſſions. 'Twas not their deſign to Flatter Senſe, but to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it. This will better appear in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing the whole Form and Manner of their Outward Worſhip.</p>
               <p>THEY offered the Sacrifice every <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>

The Hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, the People met together at the principal Church, to attend the Biſhop with all his Clergy to the place where the Station for that Day was appointed. And after this manner the Biſhop took his <note place="margin">V. Ord. Ro.</note>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:57456:104"/> round, and viſited all his Churches one by one, every one in its Courſe: And that this Progreſs might be orderly made, and in a full Body, Proceſſions were Inſtituted.</p>
               <p>As they were entring the Church and taking their places, the <hi>Choir</hi> ſung a Pſalm with its Anthem; which from thence took its name of the <hi>Introit.</hi> The <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Then the Biſhop ſeated himſelf on his Throne that ſtood at the very end of the Church, and terminated the proſpect of the whole Congregation. Thus every Biſhop was as it were the viſible Image of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 12. <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 7.</note> God in his Church, placed there eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſes it, to be the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to his own Flock, as Jeſus Chriſt was to him. The Prieſts were ſeated on each ſide about him, ſome on the right hand, and others on the left, in the Semicircle of the <hi>Abſis;</hi> and next to them ſtood the Deacons: Thus the Church ſeemed to

               <p>The Biſhop on his Throne with a Book in his Hand, as the Fathers are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly painted, repreſented that Figure of a Man under which God appeared; the Prieſts were that Auguſt Senate deſigned by the four and twenty Elders; the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and other Officers were the Angels ſtanding always in a readineſs to receive <note place="margin">

               <p>The whole Congregation being ſeated, the Reader went up to the Desk and read a Leſſon, firſt out of the Old-Teſtament,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57456:105"/> and after that another out of the new; that is, out of the Acts or Epiſtles of the Apoſtles; for the reading of the Goſpel was reſerved to ſome Prieſt or Deacon. To render theſe Leſſons the more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and to give the People leiſure to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon them, and the Readers ſome reſpite, there were intermingled with them Pſalms, Anthems, and the ſinging of Allelujas; which were afterwards pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the Goſpel. All theſe Leſſons of the Scripture, were read in the vulgar Language; that is, in the Language ſpoken by the better ſort of People in every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: For though in <hi>Africa</hi> the <hi>Punick</hi> Language was vulgarly ſpoken among the inferior ſort of People in the time of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> yet we do not find that it was uſed in the Church. But in <hi>Thebais</hi> the Scriptures muſt needs have been read in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Language ſince St. <hi>Antony,</hi>

               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:57456:106"/>
               <p>AFTER the Leſſons, the Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, <note place="margin">XXXI. Their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> the Biſhop Expounded the Goſpel or ſome other part of Scripture, and often continued a courſe of Expoſitions upon ſome entire Book of the Bible, from the beginning to the end, or elſe paſſing over ſome part of it, he made choice of the moſt important Subjects. Of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Expoſitions we have Examples in many of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom's</hi> Homilies, in St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> upon the Pſalms, upon St. <hi>John,</hi> and upon the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> In St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> we have a ſelected Argument, which begins with the ſix Days work, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of St. <hi>Baſil;</hi> then the Expoſition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to the Hiſtory of <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> and the other more Illuſtrious Saints of the Old Teſtament; but ſtill obſerving the Order of the Holy Bible. The greateſt part of thoſe Tracts and Commentaries of the Fathers upon the Scriptures are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but Sermons preached to their People; which they afterward reduced into Form, or were taken down in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as they ſpake them by the Art of ſhort Hand before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Theſe holy Preachers were none of your idle Haranguers, like the <hi>Sophiſts</hi> of the Profane Schools, who filled the World with endleſs diſputes only out of a vain Emulation of Contradicting and refining upon each others Notions; or like thoſe
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57456:106"/> who laboured in their Cloſet to ſhew their Learning and fine Parts: Theſe Prelates <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v. Aug. de oper. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach c. 29. &amp; Epiſ. ad Dioſc. v. Synes.

'Twas in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> they firſt began to make here, and there, a Prieſt of an extraordinary Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euſeb. vi. Hiſt. 20.</hi>
                  </note> a Preacher, as <hi>Origen;</hi> nay, and ſometimes the Laicks themſelves, when they found them very underſtanding Men. We find alſo in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> during the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Paulin. not.</hi>
                  </note> that St. <hi>Felix,</hi> though no more then a Prieſt, was a Preacher at <hi>Nola.</hi> But theſe Examples were ſo unfrequent, that many have taken St. <hi>John Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to have been the firſt Prieſts, to whom the Biſhops entruſted this Miniſtry.</p>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:57456:107"/>
               <p>Hence it is that our Modern Preachers find the Sermons of the Fathers ſo different from that Idea of Preaching which they have formed to themſelves. Their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are plain, without any appearance of Art, without the exactneſs of Method, without the ſubtilties of Ratiocination, without the curioſity of Learning; nay, ſome of them without any Pathos, and the greateſt part of them very ſhort. And 'tis true, theſe holy Biſhops did not ſet up for Oratory and Harranguing: They pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to no more than to inſtruct their People in a plain and Familiar way, as Parents ſpeak to their Children, or Maſters to their Scholars. And therefore their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit Diſcourſes were called in <hi>Latin, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and in <hi>Greek, Homilies,</hi> which words note ſuch kind of Diſcourſe as is uſed in common Converſation. Their buſines in expounding the Scripture, was to handle it after ſuch a manner as might prove moſt to the edification of their Hearers; ſo that they did not pretend to examin every Word and Phraſe with the exactneſs of a Critick, or to Lanch out into curious Enquiries, as the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians explained <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> in their Schools. They expounded the Scriptures according to the Tradition of the Fathers; ſo as they might tend moſt to the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Faith, and the Reformation of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57456:107"/> Manners. They endeavoured to work upon the Affections, not ſo much by the vehemence of Figures and the force of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, as by the weight and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Truths they delivered, by the Authority of their Office, by the Sanctity of their Lives and the Exemplarineſs of their good Works.</p>
               <p>As for their Stile, That they ſuited to the capacity of their hearers. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> are the plaineſt of all his Works; the Stile of them is much ſhorter and much eaſier than that of his Epiſtles; becauſe he Preached in a little City to Labourers, Traders, and Seamen; but in his Tracts of Controverſy, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his Books againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> one may ſee that he had not forgot his Art of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, which he was Profeſſor of for ſo long a time: On the contrary, St. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and St. <hi>Leo,</hi> who preached in great Cities, delivered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with more of pomp and Ornament. Yet their ſtiles vary according to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularity of their Genius, or the reliſh of the Ages they lived in. But we muſt obſerve that the faults with which the modern Humaniſts reproach the Fathers, are not to be attributed to the ſubject of Religion. Theſe Criticks charge the Fathers with Impropriety of Language; making uſe of feeble Arguments, poor
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57456:108"/> Ornaments, farfetch'd Allegories, playing with Words, and Chiming of Syllables. Theſe were the faults of the Age, not of the Men. Had they lived in the Age of <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Terence,</hi> they had ſpoken as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> and <hi>Terence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Greek Fathers come nearer to the Ancient Authors. Language had not undergone ſo great a change in the Eaſt, nor had the Studies of Polite Learning been there ſo much neglected. The works of theſe Fathers are for the moſt part ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Solid and very entertaining: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt St. <hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi> is to my thinking, the compleat Pattern of a Preacher. His uſual method was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with explaining the Scripture, verſe by verſe as pronounced by the Reader, keeping himſelf always to the moſt lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, Senſe, and that which moſt tended to Practice. He concluded with a general Exhortation, which hath many times lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle relation to the foregoing part of his Diſcourſe, but was proportioned to the preſent Exigencies of his Flock, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly applyed to his Auditors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as ſo prudent and vigilant a Paſtor ſaw their Caſe required. We may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve alſo that it was his way to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Vices Singly, one by one, and when he began with any one, he never gave over the Purſuit till it was either
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57456:108"/> entirely Routed, or at leaſt very much diſabled.</p>
               <p>Theſe Holy Preachers did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe either Fame or Profit to themſelves by Preaching, but the Converſion of their Hearers. That was the only thing they aimed at, and that they purſued with all their Might, and never thought they had done enough till they had effectually wrought the Change they deſired. Thus St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> undertook to aboliſh the Practiſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> xxix.</note> his People had taken up of making enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, on the Feaſts of the Martyrs, which were degenerated into Debauches; but notwithſtanding the ſtrength and prevalence of the cuſtome, he broke it off. He ſhewed the People the Evil of that Practiſe, from expreſs Texts of Scripture condemning the ſinfulneſs of immoderate Eating and Drinking, and with Tears in his Eyes exhorted and intreated for two Days together till he had effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. There was no danger then of having different Doctrines taught in one and the ſame Church, for there was no other Preacher or Teacher, but the Biſhop himſelf, or ſome Prieſt choſen by him, who Preached there only by his apoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and generally in his preſence.</p>
               <p>In Sermon time the Church was open to all comers, even to the Infidels: Which <note place="margin">

                        </gap> Peres c.</hi> xii.</note> is the reaſon that the Fathers were ſo

During the time of the Leſſons and Sermon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience were regularly ſeated, the Men on one ſide of the Church and the Women on the other; and to be ſeparate and at a greater diſtance from the reſt of the Congregation, the Women went up into the Galeries where there were any. The more elderly Perſons ſat in the uppermoſt Seats; their Fathers or Mothers held the little Children before them; for they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed them to Church with them, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were Baptized. When all the ſeats were filled, the younger People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtanding on their Feet. There were Deacons appointed on purpoſe to ſee this order obſerved, and to take care that every one heard with attention, not to ſuffer any body to Sleep, Laugh, Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per or make Signes; in a Word, to keep every body ſilent, Regular and Well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd.

               <p>They were willing that the Clergy even by their Figure and Appearance, ſhould give the People a great notion of their Character. That their Faces, their Hands and their Cloaths appearing clean
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57456:111"/> and without ſpots might be a ſign of an inward Purity and Innocence; that the Modeſty and Gravity of their Looks, their Air and Motion might command Reſpect and excite Religion.

               <p>The Biſhop ſtanding at the Altar, took from the Hands of the Deacons the Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they had received from the People; but in ſome Churches the Biſhop himſelf <note place="margin">Ordo.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57456:111"/> laid them up in Places appointed for that purpoſe: 'Tis true, they laid upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar the new Fruits to have a Benediction pronounced over them at the end of the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>They uſed for the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> no other Bread but what was offered by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bleſſed by the Biſhop; and as a ſign of Communion with thoſe that were <note place="margin">Epiſt. deer.

All the faithfull were obliged to offer, at leaſt all that were to Communicate; nor was it thought reaſonable that the Rich ſhould Communicate of that which the poor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.

               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:57456:112"/>
               <p>The Paſtor after the Oblation of the Bread and Wine, offered alſo the Incenſe which was to repreſent the Prayers of the faithfull; as St. <hi>John</hi> in the Apocalyps, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> viii. 3, 4, 5.</note> ſaw an Angel employed at the Altar in offering up to God theſe ſpiritual Odors. They fumed with the Incenſe (as is ſtill done) the Altar, the Oblations, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and the People; and to this uſe they apply'd none but right Perfumes, the beſt Franckincence, and other <hi>Aromatick</hi> Gums, the richeſt then known in the World; and that with ſuch a Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence too, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had Lands in <hi>Syria</hi> and other Provinces of the Eaſt appropriated for ſupplying the Altar with theſe Perfumes. During the Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, was ſung a Pſalm; of which there is now left only a Verſicle, which was with them the Anthem.</p>

Other Deacons therewere walking ſoftly about the Church to ſee that no body made the leaſt noiſe; and it was the peculiar buſineſs of one, or the leaſt ſign of them to keep an Eye over the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57456:112"/> They had a place aſſigned them near the Biſhop's Chair; and as for thoſe that were very ſmall, their Mothers were ordered to take them into their Arms: Thus all the People were kept to a deep ſilence, and heard with a profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Attention, the Prayers of the <hi>Preface,</hi> and of that part of the Service which we now call the <hi>Canon.</hi> The Biſhop Pronounced the Words with a loud Voice, and all the People ſaid <hi>Amen,</hi> as they did at the end of all other Prayers. Theſe Prayers were much longer than they are now, as is ſtill to be ſeen in the Oriental Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> retained hath <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conſt. Apo.</hi> viii. 12.</note> nothing of this form but the Eſſentials; formerly this <hi>Canon</hi> was an Abridgment of the Hiſtory of Religion, Praiſing God for the Creation of the World, for reſtoring it after the Deluge, for the call of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi> for the ſpecial Favours vouchſafed to the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and laſtly, for the Incarnation of his Son, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind.</p>
               <p>After the Conſecration, the Biſhop <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conſt. Apo.</hi> viii. 13.</note> took the Communion himſelf firſt; then he gave it to the Prieſts, then to the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and other Clerks, after them to the <hi>Aſceticks</hi> or <hi>Monks,</hi> to the Deaconneſſes, to the Virgins and other Religious Perſons, to Children, and at laſt to all the People. To ſhorten this Service, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57456:113"/> very long; many of the Prieſts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted at the ſame time, in diſtributing the Body of our Lord; and many of the Deacons in Adminiſtering of the Cup: And to avoid Confuſion, the Prieſt and Deacons carried the Communion walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the ranks of the People, in the ſame Order as they had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Offerings; none of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants ſtirring out of his place. The Men received the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in their Hands; and the Women in peices of Linnen made on purpoſe for that uſe. The Crumbs and Fragments that were left of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> they gave to little Children; and the reſt of the Bread of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but not Conſecrated, was diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted among thoſe who did not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate: <note place="margin">Ord. Rom.</note> And from hence came the <hi>Panis Benedictus</hi> or the Bleſſed Bread. During the Communion they ſung a Pſalm; of which we have now nothing left but the Anthem.

               <p>From all this it follows, that their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> muſt needs have been long: Nor
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57456:113"/> indeed did Chriſtians then think they had any thing elſe to do on Sundays but to ſerve God. St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to ſhew how his <note place="margin">

               <p>ALL the Publick Service of the Church <note place="margin">XXXIV. The Chant and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note> was accompanied with Singing. The ſame hath been obſerved of the former times; but 'tis to be ſuppoſed this publick Singing grew much more in uſe upon the Churches being freed from Perſecution: St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> aſcribes to St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> the hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Auguct.</hi> ix. <hi>Confeſs.</hi> vii.</note> introduced into the Weſt the uſe of Singing the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in imitation of the Churches of the Eaſt, and it is about the ſame time that we find St. <hi>Damaſus</hi> the <note place="margin">Lib. Pontif in Damaſo</note> Pope enjoining it. St. <hi>Baſil</hi> tells us, that in his time the Pſalms were ſung both in Private Houſes and in publick Places; and that the ſinging was ſo agreeable, that the <note place="margin">Baſil. <hi>in Pſalm.</hi> i.</note> pleaſure help'd to convey the Religion of the Hymn into the minds of the People with more advantage: And this was the true deſign of Muſick.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:57456:114"/>
               <p>The Antient Muſick was not yet loſt, which was diverſifyed into ſeveral kinds of Harmony, variouſly applyed as the Nature of the Subject did require, Soft or <note place="margin">

                  </note> Strong, Gay or Sad, Grave or Paſſionate. And we may conclude that in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the Church, they made choice of that which agreed beſt with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Purity of Religion; and that they carefully avoided to apply to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Myſteries, and the prayſing of God Soft and Eſtaeminate Airs, or ſuch as might tend to affect the Heart with too ſenſible a Tenderneſs, or put the Spirits into any <note place="margin">1.

However St. <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> thought the Singing in the Weſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what too Soft and <hi>Secular;</hi> and judged the Practiſe of St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> more Safe, who cauſed the Pſalms to be pronounced by the Reader with ſo ſmall an alteration of Voice, that it was rather plain ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then ſinging. I leave it to thoſe who underſtand this Science to inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have not ſome remains of this Antiquity in our <hi>Plein Chant</hi> or Church Muſick brought in by St. <hi>Gregory.</hi> For what we now call Muſick, is certainly a clearly Different thing and altogether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern. As for the Chanting of the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Leſſons, that we ſee conſiſts but of very few Notes, only to help to keep up the Voice, and mark the diſtinction
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57456:114"/> of the Periods. I think I have ſaid enough to ſhew how well the Biſhops of theſe firſt times, underſtood to manage the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Senſe, ſo as to make them ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the end of Religion, and by their help to make Impreſſions of Piety even upon the moſt heavy and Illiterate. For Inſtance let us ſuppoſe the ſolemn manner of their Celebrating the <hi>Vigil</hi> of Eaſter at <hi>Rome,</hi> under the Pope St. <hi>Leo.</hi> The Faithful <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V. Euſeb.</hi> vi. <hi>Hiſt. c.</hi> ix</note> on that Holy Night (with their reverend Biſhop at the Head of them) Aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a Body in the Lateran Church. In the firſt place immediately upon the Benediction of the new Fire, an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible number of Lights made the Holy Night look as glorious as a fine Day. We may imagin what a charming Sight it muſt needs have been to ſee this Auguſt Magnificent Church filled with ſuch a Numerous Aſſembly and yet in ſo vaſt a Multitude of People nothing of Noiſe, Tumult or Confuſion; but every one Regularly diſpoſed and Ranged according to the Quality of their Age and Sex, and the ſtation they held in the Church. And eſpecially diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt were thoſe who were to receive Baptiſm that very Night, together with thoſe who had accompliſhed their Pennance and had been but two Days before Readmitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church. Their Eyes were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57456:115"/> on every ſide with the Marbles and Paintings, the glittering of the Gold, Silver and Precious Stones that Sparkled upon the Conſecrated Plate, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near the Holy Altar. The ſilence of the Night admitted of no other Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Leſſons out of the Prophets Pronounced with a clear diſtinct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Voice, and intermixt with the Singing of the Verſicles; that ſo this Variety might make both of them more agreeable. So many grand and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Objects preſenting themſelves at one and the ſame time, could not but awaken the Soul and inſpire her with Vigour both to attend to thoſe Holy Leſſons and profit by them, eſpecially being prepared for them before hand, by continual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in the Word of God. What muſt the Gravity and Modeſty of the Deacons and other ſacred Miniſters have needs been, who were made choice of, and bred by ſuch a Prelate, and ſerv'd in his preſence, or rather in the preſence of God, whom their own thoughts repreſented to them always before their Eyes? But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, How Majeſtick muſt the Pope himſelf appear, ſo venerable for his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Elocution, his Zeal, his Courage, and all his other Vertues? With what an awefull Reverence, with how Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate a Piety muſt he have pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57456:115"/> over the Sacred Fonts, thoſe Prayers which he himſelf firſt Compoſed; and which his ſucceſſors have found ſo Pious, that they have ſtill preſerved the ſame for us the ſpace of twelve hundred Years? I can no longer Wonder that on theſe occaſions and under ſuch helps of Devotion, the Chriſtians of thoſe Days ſhould quite forget their Body; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faſted all the Day before, ſhould paſs this Holy Night of the Reſurrection alſo in Watching and Prayer without eating a bitt till the Day following.</p>

               <p>The Feaſts of the Martyrs had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable honours paid to them, and were Celebrated with a great Concourſe of People. On Sundays and other Feaſts, common to the whole Church, every one was content to ſtay at home with his own Biſhop. But on theſe ſpecial Feaſts, they ran from all parts to celebrate the Memory of the Saints; ſo that upon theſe occaſions many of the Biſhops themſelves
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57456:116"/> often met together at their Tombs. By one example, we may judge of the reſt.

               <p>And indeed this was a proper means of aſſiſting piety by Senſe. The ſight of the Reliques of a Saint; his Sepulchre, his Priſon, his Chains and the Inrſtuments of his Martyrdom: All theſe made a quite different Impreſſion upon the Mind from the bare hearing of theſe things ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of at a diſtance. To which add the Miracles frequently wrought at their Tombs, which often made the Infidels themſelves glad to viſit them, upon the preſſing Intereſts of their Lives and Healths. Every one knows that one of the firſt effects of the liberty of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was St. <hi>Helenas</hi> care to have due Honours done to the Holy Places of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and throughout all the Holy Land: And from that time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the practiſe of going in Pilgrimage to thoſe Places of Devotion, became more common than before. And St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> an eye Witneſs, aſſures us that there were always to be ſeen in the Holy City a vaſt <note place="margin">Hier. ad Marcell.</note> concourſe of all ſorts of Itinerant People flocking thither from all parts of the World, even Doctors and Biſhops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Nor was it then ſo difficult a thing to take ſuch long Journeys through the vaſt extent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, by
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57456:117"/> reaſon of the convenience of its ſituation all round the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, and the great Roads they had laid out in all Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the paſſage of their Armies and publick Carriages: So that it was no great adventure now to paſs from <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Gaul</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or <hi>Paleſtine</hi> or <hi>Aſia.</hi>

                     <hi>Ambros. de paenit.</hi> i. c. vii. 15. 2. c. vii. 10.</note> they did; the whole Church in her publick Service always remembring to pray for the Penitents in particular, as ſhe ſtill doth during the time of <hi>Lent.</hi> The five following years he was in the rank of <hi>Auditors,</hi> He entered the Church to hear the Inſtructions there delivered, but ſo as to remain in the <hi>Veſtibulum</hi> or Porch only, with the <hi>Catechumens;</hi> and to depart before the Prayers began: From thence he paſſed to the third Rank, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57456:121"/> was admitted to join in Prayers with the Faithful, but in the ſame place as before, and Proſtrate or lying down upon the Floor, and he went out with the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens.</hi> After having been ſeven years in this State, he paſſed to the laſt, in which he remained four years, joining in Prayer with the Faithful, and ſtanding as they did; but was not permitted to offer or Communicate with them. At laſt his twenty Years of Pennance being thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, he was again received into full Communion with the Church, and admitted to the Participation of Holy things, that is the Euchariſt.</p>
               <p>The ſame Proportion was obſerved in the Fifteen Years Pennace of the Adulterer. He was four Years among the <hi>Flentes,</hi> five among the <hi>Audientes,</hi> four with the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrati,</hi> and two with the <hi>Conſiſtentes.</hi> And by this one may judge of the other ſort of Offenders. Not that time alone did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <note place="margin">S. Baſil. ibid. 84, 85</note> determine the Pennance. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops carefully examined the Proficiency of the Penitents, and from thence took their Meaſures either of uſing them with a greater indulgence, or of deferring their Reconciliation. Their Fundamental Rule was to labour all they could for the Salvation of their Neighbour; but not ſo as to deſtroy themſelves together with thoſe who were incorrigible. The Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57456:121"/> therefore did not advance from one <note place="margin">

They prayed for him, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for him the Holy Sacrifice. When the Biſhop judged it proper to put a final Period to his Pennance, it was done at the end of <hi>Lent,</hi> that the Pennitent might reenter upon his Participation of the Holy Myſteries at the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On Holy Turſday the Penitents preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Pont. Rom.</note> themſelves at the Door of the Church. The Biſhop having offered up many Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God on their behalf, cauſed them to enter, at the inſtances of the Arch Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con; repreſenting to him that this was a time proper for Clemency, and that 'twas but reaſonable that as the Church encreaſed the number of her Flock at that time by the new Baptized, ſhe ſhould take alſo then into her fold again the ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sheep. The Arch-Prieſt alſo interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on behalf of the Penitents, and gave them his Teſtimonial that they were worthy to be reconciled. For to him it belonged to examine them during the time of their Penance. Then the Biſhop made an Exhortation to them, putting them in mind of the mercies of God,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57456:122"/> and of that newneſs of life which they ought to live in for the time to come, requiring them in token of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fent <note place="margin">

At length ſuffering himſelf to be prevailed upon by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of the Church, and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the ſincerity of their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he gave them Solemn Abſolution. Then they ſhaved and polled themſelves, quitted their Penitential habits and began to live like the other Faithful. There was without doubt great diverſity in theſe outward Ceremonies, according to the difference of times and places. But they all tended to the ſame end, and had a powerful Effect to make the offender ſenſible of the Enormity of ſin, and of the difficulty of recovering out of it; and to keep thoſe ſtill within bounds who as yet had preſerved their Innocence.

He had the Holy Scripture by Heart, and diſcourſed of it with the Biſhops as readily as if he had been one of them himſelf. He gave a great reſpect to them, and had an honour for all good Chriſtians. He cauſed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of many Saints to be tranſlated with great Pomp. He founded many Hoſpitals and many Monaſteries.</p>
               <p>His Siſter did not only exerciſe him in the Practices of Religion, but cauſed him to be taught with the greateſt care all the Accompliſhments proper for an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. He had the beſt Maſters to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him in Learning, and others to teach him the Exerciſes of Riding and <hi>Arms.</hi> He was uſed to the bearing of heat and Cold, Hunger and Thirſt. She her

He was a perfect Maſter of his Paſſion, obliging humane and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a Degree of Compaſſion.</p>
               <p>Such was <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, tho' born into an Empire in the <hi>Luxurious</hi> Eaſt, and in a very corrupt Age.

               <p>They who were not thus embodied, lived at leaſt two or three of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Prieſts who were confin'd to Churches in the Country, had with them ſome young Clerks whom they directed in their Studies, whoſe Manners they formed, and whom they kept always by them as Witneſſes of their own Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>But whether the Eccleſiaſticks lived in Common or ſeparate, they were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to have Women lodging in the ſame Houſes with them. Among the Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus,</hi> this was <note place="margin">

It was firſt Introduced upon the pretence of Charity: For theſe Perſons who lived in this manner with the Clerks were Virgins Conſecrated to God, or ſuch others that made a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57456:126"/> of Devotion; to whom the Clergy pretended to be inſtead of Fathers or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, managing their Affairs, and doing for them thoſe ſervices which they could not decently do themſelves, eſpecially in places where Women rarely appeared in Publick. And theſe devout Women on their ſide, performed for their Brothers all thoſe Domeſtick Offices which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Honour of their Profeſſion: For notwithſtanding their Inhabiting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they pretended nevertheleſs to <note place="margin">In eos qui tenent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intr.</note> keep their Vow of Continence; and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> encountring this abuſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that they effectually did ſo. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes them only of being pleaſed in ſeeing and diſcourſing with each other, That the Pleaſure of Converſation was more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Perſons of different Sex, that by this means they were carried on to Scandal and Indecency, and raſhly expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to the danger of a Crime.

And beſides the point of Cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it was not thought convenient that Eccleſiaſticks ſhould have much Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with Women, though under the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57456:126"/> pretence of Piety; or that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from them their little preſents of Habits, Ornaments, Fruits or other ſuch like Refreſhments, ſerving rather for Delight than uſe, which had any appearance of Voluptuouſneſs and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
               <p>But upon the main, the Sanctity of the Eccleſiaſticks was as yet very great; and though there were always among them Perſons who had their weakneſs, and their Paſſions, the generality of them led Lives extreamly Virtuous and Exemplary. The World likewiſe did them Juſtice, and they were much reſpected. Though the Biſhops made no great figure in the World as to Temporal Authority, and though they lived in a plain way as private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, without any thing of Worldly Pomp or outſide ſhew of Grandeur; yet they were highly honoured, not only by the People, but alſo by the Magiſtrates, and even by the Princes themſelves.

'Tis certain however there were at the ſame time in the Provinces, Biſhops who by the Frugallity of their Tables, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of their Habits, and Modeſty of their Looks rendred themſelves amiable both in the ſight of God and Man. And thus much doth this Heathen Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf own and declare of them; and that there were the like examples in the great Citys, is plain by the Inſtances I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven beſides many more that might have been added.</p>
               <p>THAT which makes this moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">XXXIX. The Riches of the Church.</note> of the Biſhops yet more remarkable, is the vaſt Riches of the Church, which immediately followed the ceaſing of the Perſecutions. One would hardly believe what I ſhall ſay on this Head, though the thing its ſelf be never ſo certain and well atteſted. All the Lives of the Popes from St. <hi>Silzveſter</hi> and the beginning of the fourth Age to the end of the Ninth are full of Preſents made to the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Popes, by the Emperors and by ſome Private Perſons. And theſe were not only guifts of Gold and Silver Plate, but Houſes in <hi>Rome,</hi> and Lands in the Country; and that not only in <hi>Italy,</hi> but in divers Provinces of the Empire. I ſhall relate no more than what was offered
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57456:130"/> by <hi>Conſtantine</hi> as <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> reports it from the Ancient Memoires that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his time.</p>
               <p>He tells us that the Emperor built and oarnamented many Churches, as firſt the <hi>Conſtantinian</hi> (the ſame with the <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran)</hi> where he beſtowed theſe gifts; <hi>viz:</hi> A Silver Tabernacle of two thouſand twenty five pound Weight, having in the front of it our Saviour ſeated in a Chair, five foot in Heigth, weighing one hundred and twenty pound; and the twelve Apoſtles each of them five foot high, and weighing fourſcore pound a peice, with Crowns of the pureſt Silver. On the back ſide was another Image of our Saviour five foot high weighing an hundred and forty pound, and four Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Angels of five foot each, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifteen pound weight, ſet with with precious Stones. He gave alſo four Crowns of the pureſt Gold, that is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with Candleſticks in them, ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with twenty Dolphins of fifteen pound each. Seven Altars of Silver of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound weight, ſeven Patins of Gold of thirty pound each, forty Calices of Gold of one pound each, five hundred Calices of Silver of two pound each: one hundred ſixty Silver Candleſtick, forty of which weighed each of them thirty pounds, the reſt twenty pound apiece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:57456:131"/> And many other Veſſels. In the <hi>Baptiſtery</hi> the Ciſtern or Font was of <hi>Porphyry,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaid with Silver to the weight of three thouſand and eight pounds. In it was placed a Golden Lamp of thirty pound weight, in which were burning at once two hundred pounds of ſweet Oyl; a Golden Lamb of thirty pound weight pouring out the Water; the Image of our Saviour of the pureſt Silver, five foot high, and of an hundred ſixty two pound weight, and on his left Hand a St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in Silver of an hundred pound weight, and ſeven Silver Harts caſting forth with Water, each of eight hundred pound, ſet with two and forty rich Stones. All that he gave to the Church and to the <hi>Baptiſtery</hi> amounted to ſix hundred ſeventy eight pound weight of Gold, nineteen thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy three of Silver: And there going but twelve ounces to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> pound, the whole amounts to one thouſand and ſeventeen Marks of Gold, and twenty nine thouſand five hundred Marks of Silver, which comes to about twelve hundred thouſand Livers, beſides the Make or faſhion; counting the Mark of Gold at three hundred Livers, and the Mark of Silver at thirty Livers- Beſides all this <hi>Conſtantine</hi> gave to the ſame Church and <hi>Baptiſtery</hi> in Houſes and Lands to the Yearly value of thirteen
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57456:131"/> thouſand nine hundred thirty four Sols of Gold which comes to more than fourſcore thouſand Livers <hi>per. annum.</hi> Counting the Golden Sol but at ſix Livers. And all this was given to that one Church, the Lateran.</p>
               <p>He built ſeven others alſo at <hi>Rome,</hi> that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Holy Croſs of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> St. <hi>Agneſs,</hi> S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Marcellinus.</hi> He made alſo great preſents to that of St. <hi>Silveſter's</hi> founding. He cauſed to be built alſo one Church at <hi>Ostium,</hi> another at <hi>Albanum,</hi> another at <hi>Capua,</hi> and another at <hi>Naples</hi> What he gave to all the Churches in Gold and Silver Plate amounted to one thouſand three hundred fifty nine Marks, and four ounces of Gold and twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred thirty ſeven Marks of Silver, which comes to near upon ſeven Hundred Fourſcore Thouſand Livers beſides the Make, The Yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, with which he endowed them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to ſeventeen thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeven Solls of Gold, that is, to more than an hundred thouſand Livers, and to the value of above twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Livers in divers ſorts of Perfumes which the Lands in <hi>Egypt</hi> were obliged to furniſh in Specie, and that counting them, but according to the price they now bear, which is incomparably leſs
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57456:132"/> than what it was then. The Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> for example, had Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in <hi>Antioch</hi> and the adjacent Country, it had Eſtates belonging to it at <hi>Tarſus</hi> in <hi>Cilicia,</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> and throughout all <hi>Egypt;</hi> nay, it had them lying as far diſtant as in the Province of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and part of the Lands ſtood charged to ſupply the Church with a certain quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Oyl of Nard, Balm, Storax, ſweet Cane, Saffron, and other precious Drugs for the uſe of the Cenſers and Lamps.</p>
               <p>To theſe we may add the Churches <note place="margin">V Euſeb. de vitae Conſt. lib. iii. c. 34. 35, &amp;c. c. 50. lib. iv. c. 58, 59.</note> that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and St. <hi>Helena</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſed to be built at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and over all the <hi>Holy-Land.</hi> That of the twelve Apoſtles, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which he founded at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for he was the Founder of all the Churches there; that at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> that at <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi> which was proportionable to the Grandeur of the City: To theſe we may ſubjoin the Liberalities he beſtowed on the <note place="margin">ibid. iv. 28.</note> Churches throughout the Empire. We may add further the Donations of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Emperors, the Gifts of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of Provinces, and of all the other great Lords who became Chriſtians; the Benefactions of thoſe Religious Matrons who quitted great Eſtates to embrace Chriſtian Poverty, as St. <hi>Paula</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:57456:132"/> and St. <hi>Melania;</hi> St. <hi>Olympias</hi> at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> and many others; to theſe in the laſt place we may reckon the Gifts of the Biſhops, between whom there was a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Emulation of exceeding each other in adorning and enriching their Churches. After all this one may judge how rich the Churches of the Capital Cities were in thoſe large Provinces which we now count for great Kingdoms: Thus we may ſee that the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly rich in the time of St. <hi>John</hi> the Almoner, by the account we have of his Pious management of thoſe vaſt Revenues and the large Charities he beſtowed out of them. We may ſee in St. <hi>Gregories</hi> Epiſtles what pains and trouble the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> gave him, diſperſed abroad in ſo many Countries, in <hi>Sicily,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> the care he took that the Slaves who were employed <note place="margin">Vita Greg, per Jo. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac. lib. ii. c. 55, &amp;c.</note> in the Tillage of them ſhould be well uſed, and the Revenues applied to the Relief of the Poor of the Countries where they lay. Nothing of all this will appear incredible to any one that is the leaſt acquainted with the Grandeur and Wealth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, where it was a common thing for private Perſons to Bequeath to <note place="margin">F. de inſtr. &amp; instrum leg.</note> their Friends whole Towns Inhabitants and all; beſides, there were great Eſtates Appropriated to the Worſhip and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namenting
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57456:133"/> of the Idols. There were great ſums yearly expended upon their Sacrifices, Plays and other Ceremonies of the falſe Religion. It was eaſy for a Chriſtian Government to enrich the Church with what uſed to be flung away upon theſe Vanities. But one of the grand Funds out of which the Churches were endowed, were the Chriſtians Eſtates <note place="margin">

St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> frequently of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to reſtore his Church-lands, but his People would not accept of them. St. <hi>John Chryſoſtom</hi> upbraids the Chriſtians of his Time, that they had by their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and hard Heartedneſs forced the Biſhops to procure ſettled Revenues to their Churches, leaſt their Virgins, Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and other Poor ſhould Periſh for want, if (as in the Primitive times) they

The Chriſtians aiming principally at the ſaving Peoples Souls, neglected none of them; and thoſe who were moſt abandoned by others, they thought beſt deſerving of their Care. They provided not only for their own Poor, but even for thoſe alſo of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. This <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate teſtifies <note place="margin">Julian. ep. ult.

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57456:134"/> of Office for the management of theſe Alms. A Deacon always reſided there, <note place="margin">

The other way of relieving the Poor, and that far better too, was both to lodge and to feed them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Common: For this purpoſe as ſoon as the Church had its Liberty, there were ſeveral Houſes of Charity built, all which we call by the common name of Hoſpitals, but in <hi>Greek</hi> they had different Appellations according to the different Qualities of the Poor for whom they were appointed.</p>

St. <hi>Anthony</hi> having for ſome time lead the Aſcetique life near the place of his Nativity, withdrew himſelf afterward into the Deſert, that he might with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter freedom and ſecurity purſue his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exerciſes, upon being removed out of the Reach of all Temptations which might be occaſioned by Society. He was
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57456:136"/> the firſt that gathered Diſciples toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Wilderneſs, and there obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to live in common. They were now no longer called ſimply Aſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, though in effect they led the ſame Life; but went by the name of Monks, that is to ſay, Solitaries, or Hermits, to wit, thoſe that inhabit the Wilderneſs. Thoſe who lived together were termed <hi>Caenobites;</hi> and thoſe who having lived a long time in common and there learn't to conquer their Paſſions, and afterwards retired to a more abſolute Solitude they called <hi>Anchoretes.</hi> And yet the <hi>Caenobites</hi> themſelves lived very Solitary, ſeeing no Soul but their own Fraternity; being at the diſtance of many Days Journy from all inhabited Places, in ſandy Deſerts, whither they were forced to carry all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, even their very Water. Nor did they ſo much as ſee one another ſave only in the evening and in the Night at their ſtated hours of Prayer, ſpending all the Day at work in their Cells either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or two and two together, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in profound Silence. Beſides, as in thoſe vaſt Solitudes, they were not ſtreightned for want of Room, ſo their Cells ſtood at a conſiderable diſtance one from another.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> St. <hi>Hilarian,</hi> St. <hi>Paco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and the others that followed their
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57456:136"/> Examples did not pretend to introduce Novelties or outdoe all that ever went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Their deſign was only to keep up the exact practiſe of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion which they ſaw every Day more and more declining. They always propoſed the <hi>Aſceticks</hi> that went before them for their Examples. As in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> thoſe Diſciples of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> who (as <hi>Caſſian</hi> relates) lived in the Suburbs of <note place="margin">

They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for their imitation the Primitive Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the Prophets. Twas not an <note place="margin">Hier. ad Paulin. item ad Ruſtic.</note> Affectation to make themſelves admired for the extraordinarineſs of their Methods, but an honeſt intention of leading the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves of good Chriſtians. This one may ſee through the whole Rule of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> which is indeed no more than an Abridgement of the Duties of a Chriſtian who would lead his Life according to the Precepts of the Goſpel, and which he lays down in general to all ſorts of Perſons. He ſaith, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Baſil reg. fas. n.</hi> xxii.</note> for example, as to Habits, that a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to content himſelf with ſuch Cloathing as is ſufficient for Decency, and to defend the Body againſt Cold and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57456:137"/> the other injuries of the Air; but to be as little incumbred as poſſible: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be content with one Garment both for Day and Night, a thing in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where he lived not impracticable. There is very little in his Rule which is perculiar to Monks ſeparate from the reſt of the World.</p>
               <p>That which was ſingular in the Monks was their Renouncing of Marriage, and <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. ad fidel. patr.</note> the Poſſeſſion of Temporal goods, and their Separating themſelves from conver ſation with the reſt of the World, either of the Faithful themſelves or their neareſt Relations.

St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> gives us a Memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hiſtory of a Young Man, whoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Ad fidel. patr.</note> was deſirous that he ſhould become a good Chriſtian, and prevailed with a Vertuous Monk to take him into his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition. This Holy Man to Inſtruct him more perfectly in the Duties of Religion,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57456:137"/> cauſes him to practiſe in Private all the exerciſes of the Monaſtick Life, without making any open Shew or Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and ſtill leading in appearance the common Life.

In the Lives of the Fathers we meet with a great number of theſe Monks that lived to fourſcore or fourſcore and ten Years; ſome to an hundred, and others more. Theſe examples we chiefly meet with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Aegyptan</hi> Monks, who were the moſt admired for their Wisdome; and who, after mature Deliberations upon long Experience, came to this concluſion, that the Dyet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Monks ſhould be <note place="margin">

They alſo conquered Avarice by their extream Poverty and by ſticking cloſe to their Rule of having nothing of their own and of diſtributing to the Poor out of the gains of every Days Labour, all that remained over and above their own Subſiſtence. And ſo conſiderable were <note place="margin">

Laſtly, they combated the paſſion of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by their Silence, and by keeping ſuch Company as obliged them to bear with one another; ſloth they encounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by continuall Labours; Sadnefs, by Prayer and ſinging of Pſalms; Pride and <note place="margin">

               <p>There were alſo ſome Monks that wrought in Husbandry, and for hire in the Harveſt and Vintages, promiſcuouſly with other Labourers: But the more perfect of them found their Thoughts too much ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by theſe Employments, and ſhut <note place="margin">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57456:138"/> There were none of them without ſome Buſineſs or other, and the leaſt was Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing Books: However the greateſt Part of them did not give themſelves to Study, and many of them could not ſo much as Read. This way of living being ſo poor, ſo laborious and mean to outward appearance brought them under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Libertines, and even of ſome <note place="margin">Chryſoſ. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. vitup.</note> Chriſtians themſelves. They made lewd Jeſts of them; they ſometimes proceeded to violence, even ſo far as to ſtrike the Monks, to drag them out of their Cells, and hawl them before the Magiſtrates: But all this ſerved only to make their Humility and Patience more remarkable. They were ſo much loved and reſpected by all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding People, and not only by the Vulgar, but even by Perſons of Quality; nor by the Laity only, but alſo by the Prieſts and Biſhops themſelves; that thoſe of the greateſt Sanctity and Capacity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them were often thought fit to be advanced to ſome Publick Miniſtry in the Church, or even to the Epiſcopal Dignity. Then they quitted their Monaſtry and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Commerce of the World; living the ſame Life with the reſt of the <note place="margin">

He himſelf quitted the Monaſtick Life at the end of five Years, for the recovery of his Health. But one may ſee by the Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he gives his Friend <hi>Theodorus,</hi> how much thoſe were to blame, who through lightneſs, diſguſt, or any other unwarant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able motive took leave of their vertue and a Monaſtick Life together. The Church put them under Pennance, but as for Civil Puniſhments they had none but the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of their Inconſtancy.</p>
               <p>The Sanctity of the Monaſtick Life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared with ſuch a Luſtre, that within <note place="margin">

                  </note> a ſhort time there ſpread all over the Eaſt many thouſands of Monks and Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

The Founding of theſe kind of Monaſteries met with no difficulty; they had neither Lands nor Poſſeſſions to make <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chryſoſt. ad fid. patr.</hi>
                  </note> them envy'd: There wanted neither Permiſſion, nor Aſſiſtance to thoſe that had a mind to forſake all and retire into unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57456:139"/> places, and build themſelves little Wooden Cells there, or of Reeds, or what the place afforded; to confine themſelves to Silence and Labour, and ſo to live not only not burdenſome to any, but to be very ſerviceable alſo to the publick, by thoſe good Works and Charities before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. Theſe Monaſteries did in time ſo <note place="margin">

Thus it was not thought reaſonable that in plentiful Countries, as <hi>Italy, Sicily</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> they ſhould be debarr'd the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege. But in what publick places ſoeve they were, the Monks ſtill kept to their ſolitary way, confined themſelves to their Cloyſters, and punctually obſerved their Rule of Silence.</p>
               <p>When they were near enough to the Cities, they came to the publick Church to hear the Inſtructions of the Biſhop, and to participate of the Holy Myſteries. They had their place allotted them ſeparate from the reſt of the Congregation, as the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and the Widows had theirs: But this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ambros. ad virg. laps. c.</hi> vi.</note> hindred them not to have in their own Houſes Oratories, where at the ſtated Hours they all met together and Prayed in common. They that lived farther from Towns, had among them Prieſts to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Divine Service and Adminiſter the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57456:140"/> Sacraments; and at laſt it was found con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that every Monaſtery ſhould have in it one Prieſt at leaſt, and one or two Deacons; and this Prieſt was often their Abbot. Thus having no occaſion to go abroad, they were ſhut up in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries as the Dead in their Sepulchres: This was the pretence that Arch-Heretick <hi>Eutiches</hi> made for his not appearing at the <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>There were alſo Monaſteries for Women, or Nunneries in the Deſerts, where they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode within Convenient diſtance of the Monks to receive mutual aſſiſtance from each other by their Neighbourhood, &amp; yet ſo far aſunder as to avoid all danger and Scandal. The Monks built the Nuns their Cells, and helped them in their moſt labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Works; the Nuns made the Monks Cloaths, and did them other ſuch-like Services. But all this Commerce of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was managed by ſome aged Perſons appointed for that purpoſe; none elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffered to go near the Nunneries. There were alſo many of theſe Nunneries founded in Cities, where all the Virgins Conſecrated to God, lived in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who before lived ſeparate in private Houſes.

               <p>The Biſhops who made their Clergy live in common, took their Method of living from the Monks; and as much as the active Life of the Clergy would permit, they conformed themſelves to it, ſo that theſe Communities were often called alſo by the name of Monaſteries, and in time they were quite confounded one with the other. In the Fifth Age the greateſt part <note place="margin">

The Pope St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> was taken out of a Monaſtery, where upon quitting the grandeur of this World <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The true uſe of the Monaſtick Life was to improve and perfect ſuch unſpotted Souls as had preſerved the Innocence of their Baptiſm; or ſuch Converted Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as deſired to Purify themſelves by Repentance. 'Twas for this end they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into their Monaſteries Perſons of all Ages and Conditions: Young Children, whom their Parents were for placing early out of the danger of the World; Old Perſons, who deſired to end their
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:57456:141"/> Lives Religiouſly; Marryed Men, whoſe Wives alſo had conſented to the ſame way of Living. In the Rule of St. <hi>Fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Cod. Regul.</note> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Braga,</hi> we find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations for all theſe Perſons. They who for their Sins were obliged by the Canons to do Penances of many Years, found it undoubtedly much more Commodious to paſs them in a Monaſtery, where the example of Living in Common, and the Conſolations received from thoſe more advanced in Years, might ſomewhat eaſe their Sorrows; than to Live at large un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in the wide World, where they could not avoid being ſingular and Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at. So that the Monaſtery became a kind of Priſon or Exile, with which great Perſons were often puniſhed; of which we have examples in <hi>France</hi> under the two firſt Lines of our Kings, and in the Eaſt from the ſixth Age.</p>
               <p>THE Monaſtick Life is a ſenſible <note place="margin">XLII. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that of the firſt Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</note> proof of the Providence of God, and of the care he hath taken to preſerve in his Church to the end of all Ages, not only purity of Doctrine, but alſo Holineſs of Life. If we call to mind what hath been ſaid of the Chriſtian Life in the ſecond part of this Treatiſe, and compare it with the Rule of St. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent uſages of the well-regulated Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:57456:141"/> we ſhall find that there is but little difference between them.</p>
               <p>I have prov'd there that thoſe Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians looked upon Religion as their main Concern, making all the Affairs of this Life ſubſervient to it: And thus it is with the Monks who ſequeſter themſelves from the world that they may be at more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to mind the moſt neceſſary Poynt. And for this Reaſon they are called <hi>The Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> a name common at firſt to all good Chriſtians. The Monks, Aſceticks and Virgins had alſo the name of <hi>Devotes</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them, from their being entirely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God.</p>
               <p>Thoſe firſt Chriſtians were very frequent both in Publick and private Prayer, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as near as poſſibly they could to the Rule of <hi>Praying always:</hi> the Pſalmody is no-where better Regulated, nor more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerved than in the Monaſteries, where it ſtill continues the ſame as St. <hi>Benet</hi> ſet it above eleven hundred Years ago. The Monks having nothing to divert them from the exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, have kept up the Practice more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly than even the Clergy themſelves. 'Tis ſuppoſed they reduced the Office into the form, in which it hath ſtood now for a long time; at leaſt they added the <hi>Prime</hi> and <hi>Complin,</hi> which at firſt were only private Prayers for every Chriſtian
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:57456:142"/> Family, or every Monaſtery to make uſe <note place="margin">3 <hi>Inſtit.</hi> iv. vi.</note> of at their own Houſes, to ſanctifie the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and ending of the Day. <hi>Caſſian</hi> declares that this Eſtabliſhment was but new in his Days. In all this the Canons are to be eſteemed as a ſort of Monks; and ſo indeed in the beginning they were, being then all of them Regulars. The Primitive Chriſtians received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion very often; fo do the Monks for the moſt part. <hi>Ruffinus</hi> tells us the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of St. <hi>Apollonius</hi> Communicated <note place="margin">S. Baſil. ep. 289, ad Caeſar. Patr.</note> every Day. The Monks kept up for a long time the Ancient cuſtom of having the Euchariſt always lying by them to Communicate themſelves, when they ſhould want a Prieſt to Adminiſter it. 'Twas perhaps for want of this Precaution, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chryſoſt. Hom.</hi> xvii. <hi>in Epiſt. ad Hebr.</hi>
                  </note> that ſome continued for the ſpace of two whole Years without receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Primitive Chriſtians ſpent much of their time in Reading the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: The Rule of St. <hi>Benet</hi> preſcribes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reg. S. Ben. c.</hi> xlviii.</note> the ſame to his Monks, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that all the time of Lent, and on all Sundays, they ſhould apply themſelves wholly to this Exerciſe. For on other Days, they ſpent much of their time in the labour of their Hands, of which Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice ſome traces are ſtill remaining; though
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:57456:142"/> it muſt be confeſſed, that of all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtick cuſtoms this is the leaſt continued. Silence was neceſſary (as is ſaid before) to avoid the common ſins of the Tongue, ſo frequent amongſt Men, and yet ſo much condemned in the Scriptures; as Reviling, evil Reports, indecent Rallery, fooliſh Jeſting, vain, Impertinent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Diſcourſes; and 'tis obſervable that the beſt-Regulated Monaſteries are thoſe wherein the rule of Silence is moſt rigorouſly obſerved. The names of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Brother according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Age or Quality, were of Old the common Appellations among Chriſtians. They were very Obedient to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and to thoſe that had an Authority over them; they were cloſely cemented in Union among themſelves; forward in exerciſing Hoſpitality towards their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and liberal in their Alms to the Poor of what ſort ſoever. All this we ſee ſtill Practiſed in the Monaſteries.</p>
               <p>BUT, mayn't it be ſaid, If the Monks <note place="margin">XLIII. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the External ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Monks.</note> pretend to no more than to live like good Chriſtians, Why do they affect ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities and diſtinctions from the reſt of the World? Why do they ſo diſtinguiſh themſelves from their Neighbours in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which are Indifferent? What means
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:57456:143"/> this ſingularity in Habit and Figure? Thoſe Peculiarities in their way of Eating, their hours of Sleep, the manner of their Lodging, in a Word, all that which makes them look as if they were a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Race of Men from the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, another ſort of Chriſtians ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among all other Chriſtian Nations? And why ſuch Diverſities amongſt the different Orders of the Religious? And all in matters neither commanded nor forbidden by the Word of God. Doth not all this look as if they had a mind by their Extraordinary out-ſide, to ſtrike the imagination of the People, thereby the better to gain Reſpect and Advantage? This is what manye imagin within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſome ſpeak out expreſly. But theſe Raſh Cenſures proceed from their want of knowledg in Antiquity; for if one will be at the pains of examining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe Exteriour Diſtinctions of the Monks, and the other Religious, he'll find that they are only the remains of ancient Manners which have been throughout the courſe of many Ages faithfully preſerved by them, while in the reſt of the World they have undergone wonderful altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>To begin with their Habits. St. <hi>Benet</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:57456:143"/> with a <hi>Tunique,</hi> a <hi>Cowl,</hi> and a <hi>Scapulary</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

The <hi>Tunique</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cloak had a long time been the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of the meaner ſort of People; and the <hi>Cowl</hi> was a kind of <hi>Hood</hi> worn by Peaſants and Poor Labourers. This Accoutrement <note place="margin">Pullo Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius alget in cucullo, Mart.</note> for the Head being a good ſence againſt the Cold, became afterwards common to all ſorts of Perſons, and ſo continued in theſe parts of Europe till about two hundred Years ago. Not only the Clergy and Men of Letters, but alſo the Nobility and Courtiers had their Capuches and Hoods of ſeveral ſorts and faſhions. The <hi>Cucullus</hi> mentioned in the Rule of St. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> ſerved inſtead of a Cloak. Thus what the <hi>Ciſtertian</hi> Monks call the Cowle, (the name importing as much) and the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictines</hi> the <hi>Frok,</hi> they are of the ſame Original, being both derived from the Old <hi>Cucullus.</hi> St. <hi>Benet</hi> gives them alſo a <hi>Scapulary</hi> to work in: It was much wider and ſhorter than they wear it now, and ſerved, as the name implies, for the carrying burdens upon their ſhoulders, and to preſerve their Tunique. This <hi>Scapulary</hi> had its Capuche or Hood as well as the <hi>Cucullus.</hi> And theſe two Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits were not worn both at the ſame time; the <hi>Scapulary,</hi> when they were at Work in their own Monaſteries; the <hi>Cucullus,</hi> or Cowle, at Church, or when they went
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:57456:144"/> abroad. Afterwards the Monks came to look upon their <hi>Scapulary</hi> as the moſt Eſſential part of their Habit; ſo that they they never left it off, but wore their <hi>Frock</hi> or Cowle over it.</p>
               <p>It appears therefore that St. <hi>Benet</hi> gave his Monks no other Habits, but ſuch as were then commonly worn by the Poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort of People in his Country. They were ſcarce any other way Diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than by an entire uniformity among themſelves, being all of them clothed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly alike; which was but neceſſary, that ſo the ſame Suits might ſerve indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently for all the Monks of the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Now 'tis no wonder that in the Courſe of eleven hundred Years, there ſhould be ſome Diverſity found, as to the colour and ſhape of their Habits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſame order of Monks that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the rule of St. <hi>Benet;</hi> conſidering the different Countries into which they ſpread, and the ſeveral Reformations made of them in ſeveral places. And as for the other Religious Orders that have been founded within five hundred Years laſt paſt, they have kept to the ſame Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits which they found in uſe in their Times. The greateſt part wear no Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen Shirts, which to us now-a-Days ſeems a ſevere Prohibition. But the wearing of Linnen Shirts was not of common uſe till
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:57456:144"/> long after St. <hi>Benet.</hi> In <hi>Poland</hi> they are not worn to this Day; and throughout all <hi>Turkey</hi> they uſe no Sheets, and but half undreſs for Bed, lying in their Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; tho' even before the uſe of Linnen-Sheets, 'twas the common cuſtom to go into the Bed Stark naked, as is ſtill done in <hi>Italy.</hi> And therefore their Rule obliges the Monks to Sleep in their Cloaths, without putting off ſo much as their Girdle.</p>
               <p>As for their Diet I have before obſerv'd, that it was an ordinary thing not only for Chriſtians, but alſo for the moſt rational Perſons among the Heathens themſelves to live on Pulſe and Fiſh, and that 'twas a common cuſtom with them to have ſome Book read to them as they ſat at Meals. I have alſo obſerved that Chriſtians did keep many private Faſts, beſides the more ſolemn ones of the Church, and that they made long Graces both before and after Meat. So that herein St. <hi>Benet</hi> hath preſcribed nothing ſingular or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; on the contrary he was ſo indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as to permit his Monks two different Diſhes of Meat and a little Wine. The <note place="margin">Reg. S. Ben. c. 39. &amp; 40.</note> Hours of Eating and Drinking obſerved by the Monks were the ſame all the World over, till this laſt Age. They Dined at <note place="margin">Phil. Com.</note> nine or ten in the Morning, as the greateſt part of labouring People ſtill do; and Sup't
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:57456:145"/> at ſix at Night. Thoſe civil Regulations <note place="margin">Conf. ord.</note> concerning the <hi>Couvrefeu,</hi> and the limited Hours of working at the Forge, ſhew that they reckoned the hours of reſt and ſleep from eight of the Clock at Night to four in the Morning, which is the moſt equal Rule of taking the middle of the Night for ſleep, and loſing as little as is poſſible of the Day.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Dormitory</hi> ſhould be without Partitions of Cells, as is directed by the Rule of St. <hi>Benet,</hi> is no more than what their Living-in-common in a ſtrict Senſe properly requires; for this is properly to Live in common, to Sleep all in the ſame Chamber and Dine all in the ſame Hall: Beſides, by this means their Poverty appeared more undiſguiſed, and their Vertue was better guarded. It was eaſy for their Superior with one Glance of his Eye, to obſerve whether any thing paſſed there contrary to Modeſty; beſides, their Rule farther required, that there ſhould be Lights always in the <hi>Dormitory,</hi> and that every ſingle Bed which conſiſted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Mat and a Coverlet, ſhould be placed in full view. This faſhion is ſtill kept up in Hoſpitals, and 'tis certain was very ancient among Chriſtians; and the Cells likewiſe (or every one's having his little Apartment to himſelf) are of very ancient uſage. But with the firſt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:57456:145"/> Monks of the Deſerts, theſe Cells were only little Hutts or Cottages where they dwelt ſeparately, ſuch as thoſe of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſians</hi> and the <hi>Camaldoli,</hi> and though there lodged two or three Monks toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the ſame Roof, yet they chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not their name; and therefore we find that the leſſer Monaſteries, which we now commonly call <hi>Priories,</hi> paſſed for a long time under the name of Cells; they were alſo called <hi>Caſae.</hi> Both the one and the other of theſe names ſeem to have been taken up from the lodgings of Slaves: For the Monks in their way of living, choſe to imitate the condition of the pooreſt and moſt deſpicable of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Beſides, methinks I can trace in our Monaſteries the Model of the old <hi>Roman</hi> ways of Building, as 'tis deſcribed in <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truvius</hi> and <hi>Palladius.</hi> Their Church, that it might be free and convenient for Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, was always in the front of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery, and ſeems to have ſucceeded in the ſtead of the firſt Hall, which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> called the <hi>Atrium:</hi> From thence you paſs into a Court ſurrounded with cover'd Galleries, to which they ordinarily gave the <hi>Greek</hi> name of <hi>Periſtilium;</hi> and this is the proper Cloiſter it ſelf, into which was a paſſage from the Church, and out of which you are led into the other parts of the Houſe; as the Chapter-houſe which
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:57456:146"/> was for <hi>Exedra</hi> of the ancients; the <hi>Refec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> or <hi>Triclinium,</hi> and the Garden which ordinarily ſtands behind all the reſt, which was the way of the ancients.</p>
               <p>But let that be as it will, certain it is, that thoſe Holy Perſons, who formed their Rules for the Monks, had no deſign of introducing Novelties, or of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves by the ſingularities of their Methods. That which makes the Monks appear now ſo ſtrange and extraordinary, is the change of other Mens Manners; as the moſt ancient buildings are become ſingular, becauſe they are the only Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks left us that have ſtood for ſo many Ages. And as the more judicious any Architect is, ſo much the more curious is he in finding out the imperfect remains of thoſe old Buildings, as well knowing that that the Art of Building hath in theſe laſt Ages been recovered only by the imitation of theſe excellent Models: So Chriſtians ought exactly to obſerve the Practice of the moſt regular Monaſteries, to give them a view of the beſt examples of a life truly Chriſtian. I know there is ſcarce any thing which the length of time hath not ſomewhat impaired; ſo there is no old building which time hath entirely ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and of many-a-one there remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but miſhapen Ruins; and yet by taking an exact view even of theſe Ruins,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:57456:146"/> and examining the very leaſt Fragments of theſe precious Antiquities, and then by comparing them with their Hiſtories in the Books of the Ancients; we come at the ſame time both to underſtand the true proportions of the whole Fabrick, and the true ſenſe of the ancient Writings. After the ſame manner great uſe might be made of our Enquiries into the Monaſtick prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, if together with them we alſo read the Rules of the Founders of the ſeveral Orders, the old Canons, the writings of the new Teſtament, and the lives of the Saints of all Ages. In the mean time it cannot be denied but that the Monaſteries have been the Repoſitories of all ſorts of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: The greateſt part of thoſe old Manuſcripts were found in them, by the help of which, Learning hath been reſtor'd in theſe laſt Ages: In them were preſerved the Works of the Fathers, and the Canons of the Councils. We diſcover every day in the Statutes and Cuſtoms of ancient Monaſteries, Eccleſiaſtical Antiquities of the greateſt Curioſity: In a word, the Evangelical Practice in the Cloyſters hath been all along kept up to its primitive Purity, while in the World it hath been every Day changing from worſe to worſe; and 'tis this Declention of Religion I am now entring upon.</p>

We will proceed therefore to take a general view of the progreſs of this decay.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had declared for Chriſtianity, the Converts came into it, in ſhoals; and what the Prophets had of old Predicted concerning the Church was literally accompliſhed; that ſhe ſhould be eſtabliſhed on the top of the Mountains <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſ.</hi> ii. 3.</note> and that all Nations ſhould flow in unto her, to learn from her the Law of God, and the Rule of living. On the one ſide men with their own Eyes beheld the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Miracles which were every day wrought at the Tombs of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; the holy Lives of the greateſt part of Chriſtians, and the invincible force of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:57456:147"/> this Religion, againſt which three hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Years cruel Perſecution had prevail'd no farther, than to give it the deeper root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. On the other ſide, Idolatry, and the Fabulous <hi>Theology</hi> of the Poets was long before ſo expoſed by the Philoſophers, that almoſt all the Men of Wit and Senſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them believed nothing of it, but kept up the Religion of the People only for their own Intereſts; and therefore they readily quitted it, when it was no longer ſupported by publick Authority; and moſt of them turned Chriſtians: Others out of a Libertine Opinion or Practice e'en continued as they were without hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Religion at all; either becauſe they could not bring their underſtandings to ſubmit to the obedience of Faith, or that they would not quit their Debauchery or forgo their ill gotten Goods, or the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt methods of raiſing their Fortunes.</p>
               <p>There were ſcarce any Pagans left but of theſe two ſorts; the groſs ignorant vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who were governed by Cuſtom only and who were not capable of any thing higher than the impreſſions of Senſe; and ſome affected Wits who to ſhew their parts and Learning, and out of a blind Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Antiquity, were reſolved to maintain the cauſe of Paganiſm, and to that end underpropped it with the Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical explications of ſome Philoſophers
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:57456:148"/> Fables. Theſe were the Platonicks of thoſe times, far from the good Senſe and Solidity of <hi>Plato</hi> and the ancient <hi>Academicks</hi> his Diſciples: Theſe fanciful Wits picking up what was moſt weak in the Doctrin of <hi>Plato,</hi> and mixing it with that of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and with the Myſteries of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> patch't up a kind of Religion, which at the bottom was founded upon Magick, and which under the pretence of Worſhiping good or bad Spirits authorized all ſorts of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Such was the Religion of <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, and we ſee ſomewhat of it in the Maxims of <hi>Apuleius</hi> in <hi>Porphyry</hi> and <hi>Jamblichus.</hi> But there were few that penetrated into theſe ſubtilties, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm ſunk every day more and more into Contempt.</p>
               <p>Among ſo great a multitude of new Chriſtians it was impoſſible that ſome ſhould not paſs in the Crowd, drawn in only by Temporal Conſiderations, upon the hopes of making their Fortunes under Chriſtian Princes, Complaiſance to their Friends and Relations, the fear of diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Maſters; and in a word, upon <note place="margin">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:57456:148"/> that ſtrictneſs of Life which Chriſtianity requires; they were for deferring their Baptiſm as long as they could, and often to the point of Death, that ſo they might to the laſt continue the unhappy liberty of committing Sin, without Subjecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Diſcipline of Pennance. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers proceeded even to Baptiſm, and were <note place="margin">

                  </note> not in their Hearts true Converts. Some light inquiſitive People were drawn in purely out of a curioſity to know the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries which were revealed to none but the Faithful. Their Superſtition made them greedy after Religion, and ambitious of being initiated into all ſorts of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and to participate in every thing which bore the name of Sacred, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinguiſhing the true God, or the true Religion. Among ſo many preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to Chriſtianity, what caution ſoever the Prelates could uſe; They were but Men, and it was impoſſible they ſhould not ſometimes be miſtaken.</p>
               <p>Many even of thoſe that were Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in good earneſt, grew every Day more and more remiſs. The fear of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">

Their ſecurity from outward danger betrayed them into that great hazard of Laying aſide their Watchfulneſs. Even in the ſtate of perſecution, during the Intervals
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:57456:149"/> of their Troubles, there was perceived a ſenſible abatement of Chriſtian fervour: Of this the Fathers very much complain; aſcribing the hotteſt Perſecutions to this remiſneſs of Zeal, when ever they enjoyed the leaſt Reſpite from their Enemies. How muſt it then have been with them in a ſure and ſettled Peace, when twas not only not dangerous to be a Chriſtian, but alſo Honourable and advantageous? The Princes and Magiſtrates being Converted to the Faith, ſtill maintained their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Grandeur; and were never the leſs good Chriſtians for looking after their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral concerns, and exerciſing their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: So the common ſort of Believers ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion and Worldly greatneſs ſo fairly reconciled in theſe examples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think there was no ſuch great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Honours, Riches, and other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of this Life. Thus the Love of pleaſure, Covetouſneſs and Ambition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived in them. The World was now become Chriſtian, yet ſtill the World was the ſame. They began now to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh between Chriſtians, and Saints, and Religious. We find St. <hi>John Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi> frequently complayning of it, that <note place="margin">Chryſoſt ad fidel. patr.

               <p>To this, add the Corruption of Nature that turns Food into Poyſon. The Church had in her publick Offices ſome kind of Obſervances more agreeable to outward Senſe. Theſe were eaſily abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Fleſh, and applyed to wrong Ends, contrary to the Iuſtitution of them. The Sunday Rejoycings, and thoſe of the other Grand Solemnyties exceeded ſometimes the Bounds of Sobriety and <note place="margin">Baſil. Orat. de Ebriet.</note> Chriſtian Moderation. So that in the fourth Age they were obliged (as I have <note place="margin">

                  </note> before obſerved) to aboliſh the cuſtome of making Entertainments at the Feaſts of the Martyrs, and the Clergy were alſo Prohibited from being preſent at thoſe of Marryages. <hi>Origen</hi> hath well obſerved <note place="margin">Orig. cont. Cels.</note> how difficult a thing it is to reconcile ſenſible Pleaſure with Spiritual joy. The Body is a Slave, which if too much Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd and Pamper'd with Food, Sleep, or other ſuch like Indulgences, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently become Inſolent and grow upon us; Uſurp upon the <hi>better part,</hi> take off
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:57456:150"/> the mind from applying it ſelf to Spiritual things, and weaken its power of bearing up againſt Temptation. Nor can the Spirit maintain its dominion over the Fleſh, but by a ſevere Conduct and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Application. I ſpeak here of the ſame times I have juſt now deſcribed in the third part; and do rip up in them alſo the leaſt Faults, that ſo I may the better trace out the very firſt beginnings of the Declenſion of Chriſtian Piety, without deſigning in the leaſt to invalidate what I there ſaid of the Manners of the Church in general, or of its Diſcipline, which was ſtill preſerved in its full vigor: And above all the Sanctity of their Clergy was extraordinary. However it muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there were ſome Prelates too ſenſible of the great Honours that were paid them. And ſome alſo were accuſed of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſemployed the great Eſtates of which they had the Diſpoſal. One may ſee what Complaints were preferred to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> againſt <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> and <hi>Ibas</hi> upon this account. I believe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Chalc. Act.</hi> iii. <hi>&amp;</hi> x.</note> there can ſcarce be found any of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Biſhops of thoſe times juſtly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame Reproach. But as the <hi>Arrians</hi> and other Hereticks had alſo their Biſhops and Prieſts; Their Paſſionate Conduct leſſened in the eyes of the World, the Honour of the order it ſelf. 'Twas
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:57456:150"/> a great ſcandal to the <hi>Pagans</hi> and weak Chriſtians to ſee Perſons that had ſuch Venerable Titles, Maſters of ſo little Temper, and diſputing with ſuch heat againſt the other Biſhops and Prieſts, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them with Injuries and aſperſions both in their Diſcourſes and Writings. Coming to the Court, Solliciting the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Prince to ſupport their Party. For the Hereticks omitted none of theſe Practiſes. One might have ſeen the Monks, tranſported with a miſtaken Zeal, leaving their Solitudes, flocking to the Cities, raiſing Seditions, and committing unheard of Inſolencies. Theſe diſorders Reigned pincipally in the Eaſt, where the Spirits of Men being generally of a more hot and inflexible Temper, their Paſſions preſently took fire, and carried them to the higheſt Exceſſes. In the mean time this mightily ſunk in the eyes of the World, the reſpect due to Perſons Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to Religion, and conſequently the honour to Religion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>The outward appearance of vertue in the Heathens, was another Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block to the Weak. For ſome there were that led lives Morally good: Were true to their Word, Juſt in their Dealing, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred Fraud and Avarice; in a Word, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. in Io. tract.</hi> xlv.</note> obſerved all the Laws and Rules of civil Society. Pretending that it was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:57456:151"/> for a Man to Live up to the light of Nature, and follow the Law of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, without troubling themſelves with thoſe diſputes, which divided the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. As if the Chriſtians did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to follow the ſovereign Reaſon, that is, the Word Incarnate. Theſe wiſe-Men of this World looked upon Faith as an inſtance of weakneſs a prejudice of the Underſtanding; and reckoned Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, a rigorous chaſtity, forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Spectacles</hi> and Profane Diverſions, as a piece of Superſtition. Now, though Chriſtianity was the Religion of the Prince, yet the number of Pagans was ſtill ſo great that there was no hindering <note place="margin">V. Aug.

Thus matters ſtood when the Empire ſunk in the Weſt; and though it
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:57456:152"/> continued longer in the Eaſt, yet it was only till it met with the like violent Shock. There was neither Diſcipline in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor Authority in their Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor diſpatch in their Councils, nor Conduct in their management, nor Vigor in their Youth, nor Prudence in the Aged, nor Love for their Country, nor any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Common-good; every one minded himſelf only, his own Pleaſures and private Intereſts, and baſely either Neglected or Betrayed the Publick.

'Tis eaſy to imagin with what diſtraction all Mens minds were filled; what would become of their Lives and Fortunes, of themſelves and their families; how to ſecure their Perſons from Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and their Wives and Daughters from Violation. Theſe were preſſing Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and violent Temptations to them to neglect their Spiritual concerns: A Man muſt have been endowed with a very Heroick Reſolution to maintain the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his Mind in the midſt of the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Slaughters, the diſmal deſolations, and all the other terrible Ravages of a Brutiſh Conqueror.

               <p>'Tis true the Barbarians were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The <hi>Francs</hi> turned Chriſtians, the <hi>Goths</hi> and the <hi>Lombards</hi> of <hi>Arians</hi> became good Catholicks; but ſtill they remained Barbarians: I call <hi>Barbariſm</hi> here, that diſpoſition of Mind by which Men govern themſelves not by Reaſon, but by Paſſion or by Cuſtom. We have remarkable inſtances of the Power of Cuſtom in the <hi>Iroques</hi> and the other People of <hi>America,</hi> whom we call Savages. We have ſcarce ever heard of any Nation leſs given to Women, or leſs Subject to the Paſſion of Anger; they are very Patient, great admirers of Juſtice and Gratitude, Liberal and Hoſpitable: But to this very Day it hath been almoſt impoſſible to make Chriſtians of them, except thoſe who have been brought up among the <hi>French,</hi> and from their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy familiarized to our Cuſtoms; not that they want Reaſon or Underſtanding in thoſe things they are bred to, but they are incapable of receiving new Impreſſions. They can form to themſelves no notion of one God the Creator of the Univerſe, and Governour over all Nations: They cannot apprehend the reaſon why there ſhould be but one only Religion in the whole World; they cannot be affected with the hopes of a life to come; nor comprehend what we mean when we tell
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:57456:156"/> them of an happineſs purely Spiritual; and much leſs do they underſtand us when we declare to them the more ſublime My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Religion. They will patiently hear what he have to ſay without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting us: but when we have ſaid all we can, one may plainly perceive they are nothing moved at it: If we put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Baptiſm, 'tis an ordinary thing with them to deſire it, if they find it will be for their Intereſt, or if they can but get ſome little Toy by it; but as ſoon as they have gained their ends they think no more of their Vows; they return to their own People, follow their old trade of eating the Fleſh of Men again, and torturing their Enemies to Death. There are other Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians abſolutely ſtupid, as the <hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Cafres,</hi> in whom we find no Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of any Religion at all; ſuch dull heavy Souls that nothing but what is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and Palpable can enter into their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; all theſe poor Creatures muſt firſt be made Men before they can be made Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay that the <hi>Franks</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther People who Conquered the <hi>Romans</hi> were Barbarous to this degree; but it is certain that they had nothing of Learning among them, nor any uſe of Letters; that they apply'd themſelves never to Arts nor Agriculture; that they lived by Blood
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:57456:156"/> and Plunder, and were ſo fierce and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage in their Natures, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were even ſcared at the very ſight of ſuch horrid Figures. We ſee a great deal of Inconſtancy and Inequality in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which ſeems to be the proper Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Barbarians: For the principal effect of reaſon is Conſtancy and Conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in a Man's Deſigns and Actions; 'tis not to act like Men to be given up to diverſity of Paſſions, as objects ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves. It muſt be owned there appears much Irregularity and Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction <note place="margin">viz french.</note> in the Lives of <hi>Our</hi> firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings; <hi>Clovis</hi> and his Sons after him diſcover on the one ſide much reſpect and Zeal for Religion; but on the other, they fell into many notorious Acts of Injuſtice and Cruelty.

One ſign that they did not eaſily confide in the Barbarian Converts is, That for the ſpace

The Hiſtorians, Poets, and other profane Authors were now but little regarded by them, that they might have more leifure to apply themſelves only to Religion, which yet may receive great ſervice from theſe Foreign Studies, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying us with Critical Learning, and the knowledge of Antiquity: 'Twas for want of theſe helps that they were too ready to receive ſuch Suppoſititious Writings as
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:57456:157"/> were impoſed upon the World under the ſpecious Names of ancient Eccleſiaſtical Authors; as alſo that they became too cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous in the beleiving Miracles. It was a thing ſo certain that the Apoſtles and their Diſciples had wrought many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and that many true ones were daily performed too at the Tombs of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; that they were not now ſo curious in enquiring into them, as to diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe. The more ſurprizing Relations of this nature any Hiſtory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the more taking it was. Their Ignorance in Philoſophy and the little knowledge they had of Nature, made them take all ſtrange Appearances for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, and interpret them as the ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sings of God's Wrath.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:57456:158"/> and Solemniſing the Feſtivals of the Church. Nothing is more famous in Hiſtory than the Chappel of <hi>Charlemain;</hi> as he was for the moſt part travailing, he cauſed to he carried along with him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, ſacred Ornaments, and all other things neceſſary for the performance of the divine Offices, with a numerous train of Clergy made up of ſelected Perſons. In his Travailling Chappel the ſervice was performed with as much magnificence as in any Cathedral Church: His example was followed by the Princes that ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and herein as in every thing elſe theſe Princes were imitated by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral great Lords who built their Fortunes upon the Ruin of this Family: During all theſe times there were Prelates of a very exemplary Life, conſtant in Prayer and Zealous for the Converſion of Souls, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thoſe that planted the Faith in <hi>Gallia Belgica, Germany</hi> and the other remote Climates of the North. The Biſhops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed daily in their Authority. Beſides the dignity of their Office, and the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of their Lives, their capacity for bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and their tender Affection for the People doubly recommended them during the incurſion of the Barbarians, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten interpoſed and put a ſtop to the fury of the Conquerors, to ſave their Cities from Plunder at the peril of their own

                  <hi>Agnan,</hi> but St. <hi>Deſiderius</hi> of <hi>Langres</hi> and St. <hi>Nicaſius</hi> of <hi>Reims,</hi> loſt their Lives for their Flocks, having their Throats cut by the <hi>Vandals.</hi> When theſe Barbarian Kings turned Chriſtians, the Biſhops made part of their Councils, and were the moſt truſty of their Miniſters: They did what they could to recommend Gentleneſs and Clemency to them, often interceding for Criminals, and making uſe of ſeveral me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to this purpoſe: 'Twas for this end they were ſo very careful to have the rights of <hi>Sanctuary</hi> maintained; a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege which at firſt the Veneration of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, and afterwards of ſome illuſtrious Saints, had procured to the places of their Sepulchre, as in <hi>France</hi> to that of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin.</hi> Hence alſo ('tis plain) came in the Cuſtom of putting out Peoples Eyes who ought to have ſuffered Death; they thought to put them out of a capacity of doing more miſchief in the World, and yet give them time to Repent; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they ſhut them up in Monaſteries.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops alſo made uſe of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit they had with their Princes, to reſtrain them from Acts of Injuſtice and Oppreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to procure the Relief of the Poor, and the common good. To theſe ends and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:57456:159"/> purpoſes they frankly employed the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Church. He that reads what <note place="margin">V. Anaſtas.</note> good Works the Popes have done, from the time of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to <hi>Charlemain;</hi> both in repairing the Ruins of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Reedifying not only the Churches and Hoſpitals there, but likewiſe the Streets and <hi>Aquaeducts;</hi> as alſo preſerving all <hi>Italy</hi> from the Violence of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> and the Avarice of the <hi>Greeks:</hi> He that reads the Lives of St. <hi>Alnulphus,</hi> St. <hi>Eligius,</hi> (St, <hi>Audoenus)</hi> St. <hi>Ligarius,</hi> and the other Prelates who had a great hand in the Management of the publick Affairs in thoſe Days: He may ſee that Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity is ſo far from interfering with the Intereſts of the State, that it is indeed the ſureſt foundation of true Politie, as being the beſt means of Uniting Men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and making them ſerviceable to each other in Society.</p>
               <p>This great Reputation of the Biſhops and Abbots inſenſibly drew them in to ſhare in the Temporal Power. They were Lords, and had the ſame priviledges with Lay-Peers, but ſtill with the ſame Incumbrances: As to furniſh out Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the Service of the State, and often to lead them in Perſon. The different Nations were in time ſufficiently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed to make the Clergy either of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> or <hi>Romans.</hi> But an intire alteration
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:57456:159"/> in their Behavior, was much more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. 'Twas very hard to reſtrain them from Hunting, and the exerciſe of Arms after their Ordination; eſpecially when by the orders of their Prince, they were obliged to appear in the Field. Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can it be denyed, but that thoſe <hi>Temporal Seigneuries</hi> annexed to <hi>Spiritual Dignities</hi> were a great cauſe of the decay of Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>IN the Eaſt they never had any of <note place="margin">XLVII. The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Chriſtians in the Eaſt from the fifth Age.</note> theſe Temporalties. But there were other cauſes there which produced as bad effects. The great Hereſys, which took their Riſe and Courſe in thoſe parts, had ſet the Wits of many too buſily on Work, and ſhaken the Foundation of their Faith. <hi>Neſtorius</hi> on the one ſide and <hi>Eutiches</hi> or rather <hi>Dioſcorus,</hi> on the other, had vaſt numbers of followers. Their diſputes were endleſs, and from diſputing they often fell into Quarrels and Seditions. The Clergy and Monks, who were the moſt Zealous, brake forth into the greateſt Heats; and when theſe laſt above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, eſpouſed the Quarrel, ſo far as to quit their Solitudes and flock to the Citys to maintain the Cauſe of God, (as they thought) there were no methods too Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or Violent for them. Tis well known what bloody Tragedies were Acted in
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:57456:160"/> 
                  <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> by the oppoſers of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Emperors endeavouring by their ſecular authority to remedy the Evil, did only encreaſe it. For inſtead of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to ſee the Deciſions of the Church put in execution, by Chaſtiſing and Suppreſſing the Obſtinate and Seditious by force, they engaged themſelves in the Controverſy, and to end the Diſpute, made uſe of dangerous Accommodations, determining the Point by their Imperial Edicts. And at length, encouraged by the ſervile compliances of the Biſhops, they undertook the regulation of the Church Diſcipline, that is to ſay, they ruined it. For there was now no other rule left but the Emperor's Will and Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the Eaſt was yet in Being; yet they were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Romans</hi> ſave only in Name, nor <hi>Greeks</hi> but in Language. 'Twas a meer Hotch Potch of all ſorts of <hi>Barbarians, Thracians, Illyrians, Iſaurians, Armenians, Perſians, Scythians, Sarmatians, Bulgarians</hi> and <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</hi> So that in all Hiſtory we ſcarce meet with a People more corrupt then theſe later <hi>Greeks.</hi> They had the Vices of the Antients, but nothing of their Wit and Ingenuity, or of their Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. And yet they were all Chriſtians, and very careful to keep up the outward
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:57456:160"/> ſhew, the pomp and formalities of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Mahometans</hi> had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Eaſt, the Chriſtians of thoſe parts could not avoid keeping great Commerce with them. Great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Greeks</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> liv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Subjection. For the Conqueſt of the <hi>Muſulmans</hi> (as the followers of <hi>Mahomet</hi> call themſelves) eſtabliſhed their falſe Religion, without aboliſhing the exerciſe of the Chriſtian, in the places where they found it. Their Religion was too abſurd to be received by them who had ever been enlightned with the true Faith, ſince it taught Men to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in a Man that pretended himſelf to be ſent from God, upon his own bare Word; without any Prophecy foretelling his coming, without any Miracle to prove his Miſſion, or Reaſon to Support his Doctrine. That which got him followers, was his Addreſſiing himſelf to the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> a ſort of <hi>Barbarians</hi> as Ignorant as himſelf, the happy ſucceſs of his Arms, and fairly dividing the Spoils with them. The Chriſtians had him in Deteſtation, and were a long time ſubject to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans</hi> before they could ſo much as think of being in the leaſt reconciled to their Religion.</p>
               <pb n="302" facs="tcp:57456:161"/>
               <p>But at laſt they came to it; and at the end of Two hundred Years, the Empire of the <hi>Muſulmans</hi> being now in its full Glory under <hi>Califs,</hi> their Religion began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear leſs frightful to the Chriſtians, who were now grown miſerably Ignorant, and had their Spirits broken by a long Servitude. The Original of <hi>Mohometiſm</hi> was now grown Old enough to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed and ſet off with the Embeliſhments of a vaſt many fabulous Stories. The <hi>Pompous Gallimafrys</hi> of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> where the Name of God appearing in every page, enough to impoſe upon the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. It every where Inculcates the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, and the Abhorrence of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: It ſpeaks with great vehemence concerning the laſt Judgment, Hell, and Paradiſe; it make honourable mention of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and Martyrs, and gives high Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Beſides it imitates ſeveral of the External Parts of Chriſtianity. The Chriſtians Prayed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times a Day, the <hi>Muſulmans</hi> Prayed five: The Chriſtians had their Annual Faſt of forty Days, the <hi>Muſulmans</hi> have theirs of twenty nine, keeping always ſtrict Faſt till Night, as the Chriſtians then did: The Chriſtians keep Sunday Holy; the <hi>Muſulmans</hi> Friday: We aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble in our Churches to Pray to God,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:57456:161"/> hear the Reading of the Scriptures and the Inſtructions of the Prieſt; they alſo Pray after their manner, in their Moſchs, Read their Alcoran there, and hear the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of their Doctors. They make Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages to the Land which they Eſteem Holy, and viſit the Tombs of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Martyrs. 'They give much Alms, and have Hoſpitals Founded among them in great numbers. They have alſo ſome ſorts of Religious Perſons, who live in Common, and afflict the Body after a Terrible manner. For there is no ſort of Exteriour Auſterities which Perſons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Vertue may not Imitate, either out of Vain Glory or for Intereſt. But they can never bring themſelves to live in Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Labour without being ſeen of Men. To do this, a Man muſt be a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Our Travellers Bred up in the midſt of Chriſtendom, are often affected with this outſide of Religion, and thoſe Moral Vertues they meet with amongſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; and ſometimes return Home ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in their Thoughts, and inclining to believe that all things are indifferent in matters of Religion. Under how great Temptations then muſt thoſe poor Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have layn, that were Born under the power of thoſe Inſidels, and obliged to paſs their whole Lives with them;
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:57456:162"/> kept under Oppreſſion by them, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other means of making their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Comfortable in this World, but by quitting the Faith of their Anceſtors. 'Tis a wonder they were not all Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And the number of Chriſtians ſtill remayning throughout all the Levant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Thouſand Years of Temptation, is a manifeſt proof of the power of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and of the weakneſs of <hi>Mahometiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Chriſtians alſo that were ſubjects to the Emperors of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> might be eaſily corrupted by their Commerce with the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and the ſeveral ſorts of Hereticks that Infected all the Eaſt. The Judgment of the Emperor <hi>Leo,</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Sect of the <hi>Iconoclaſts</hi> is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been corrupted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Saraſins or the <hi>Arabian, Mahometans.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Michael Balbus</hi> paſſed for no better than half-a-<hi>Jew.</hi> The Young Emperor <hi>Michael</hi> the third, with the Lewd Companions of his Debauches, acted over in a moſt execrable mockery the Holy Ceremonies of our Religion, even to the Tremendous Sacrifice it ſelf; and not long <note place="margin">V. Baron. an. 853.

This makes me ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that of all Chriſtians, the <hi>Greeks</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:57456:162"/> were the firſt Authors of Libertiniſm in matters of Religion. Not that I would be thought to fix this ſuſpicion on the whole Nation of them, but only upon ſome of their great ones, and other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons. For in theſe times, generally ſpeaking, Religion bore up nobly through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole <hi>Greek</hi> Empire. They had among them great Doctors, great Biſhops, and eminent Religious, beſides many Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs too in defence of the Holy Images.</p>
               <p>IN the Weſt the Faith was hitherto <note place="margin">XLVIII. The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Weſt. The diſorders of the tenth Age.</note> kept Inviolate. It never enter'd into the thoughts of any Man to call the principles of Religion in Queſtion, nor was it here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with Hereſy. But Ignorance and Barbariſm increaſed upon it. <hi>Charlemain</hi> did all he could to re-eſtabliſh good Lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature and Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline: But the following Princes did not purſue his great deſigns: So that after his Days both Church and State fell into greater Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then ever. The Faith had been before planted in <hi>Saxony, Bavaria,</hi> and all the reſt of <hi>Germany.</hi> But to ſecure it among thoſe rugged Nations, <hi>Charlemain</hi> was oblig'd to back the Preaching of the Goſpel, with the Sword and Temporal Puniſhments; ſo that there were many involuntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, which by the unhappines of the Times was not ſeconded with that care,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:57456:163"/> which was neceſſary to have given Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſure rooting in a new and unbroken Soil; ſo that one may eaſily imagin there remained at the bottom, a Core of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Spiritual Inſenſibility. And this perhaps is one of the Cauſes why Schiſm and Hereſy have ſince found ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy an Acceſs, and ſpread themſelves all over the North. The Civil Wars which were carryed on from the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnaire,</hi> turn'd all things back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, into a ſtate of Ignorance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; even in the ſoundeſt parts of the French Empire. And to compleat their miſery, the <hi>Normans,</hi> as yet <hi>Pagans,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaged and deſtroyed it on every ſide. The <hi>Huagarian Pagans</hi> alſo, overran <hi>Italy;</hi> the <hi>Saraſins</hi> for a long time hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their <hi>Coaſts,</hi> keeping them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon the Allarm, and at laſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Apulia</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> beſides <hi>Spain</hi> which they had now Poſſeſſed for more then an Age. So that what Remainders had been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to left of the Old <hi>Roman</hi> Manners, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Genius, were now perfectly worn out.</p>
               <p>The loſs of Arts, Learning, and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity had been the more Supportable, had not the Intereſts of Religion been invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their Fate, which cannot ſubſiſt, without both Study and Preaching; the one to preſerve in it the Soundneſs of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:57456:163"/> the other the purity of its Morals. Religion muſt neceſſarily fall into Decay, unleſs the Holy Scriptures be diligently Read, Taught and Explained to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; unleſs the Apoſtolical Traditions be preſerved in their Purity, and Purged from time to time of thoſe Spurious Additions, which the Inventions of Men make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any juſt Authority. All this was a thing hard to be done in the miſerable times of which we are now ſpeaking. The greateſt part of the Layety neither had Books, nor indeed could ſo much as Read. And if ſome of the great Lords had amongſt their Rarities ſome Antient Authors, yet they were not able to uſe them being Written in Latin. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin was now no longer in common uſe; and in the French and the other Vulgar Languages, which were as yet but in their beginning, and unformed, nothing was Written (So that as they could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the one, they had nothing to Read in the other.) But the publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Church, were performed in Latin; and the Scriptures were Read to the People in the ſame Language, but ſeldom Explained. The Lords, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the little Wars, they continually had one againſt another, kept themſelves cloſe ſhut up every one within the Walls of his own Caſtle, ſo that they ſeldom
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:57456:164"/> came near the Epiſcopal City, eſpecially if they chanced to be (as it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) at War with the Biſhop himſelf. They were forced therefore to be content with the private Maſſes of their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, or the Office of the Neighbouring Monaſteries. But the Monks were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſigned for the buſineſs of Preaching, nor could they, without their own Walls, exerciſe any thing of Diſcipline or Correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

For moſt of the Biſhops themſelves, Preached ſo very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that we find there were many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons made, requiring them to explain to the People in the Vulgar Language the Creed and the Lords Prayer, that is to ſay, the firſt Rudiments of Religion, or as we now call it, the Catechiſm. In this groſs darkneſs, who could have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:57456:164"/> how far Ignorance and Credulity might improve, but that we have the Marks of it ſtill extant in the Old Legends of thoſe times? The Prieſts and Clergy were in too mean a Capacity themſelves to be able to inſtruct others. Under thoſe Univerſal Hoſtilities with which the World was then Haraſſed, they were alſo forced to take up Arms in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and with Sword in Hand to ſecure the temporalities of the Church by which they Subſiſted. Many of them were by their Poverty neceſſitated to betake themſelves to ſordid Employments; or elſe to travel about from Province to Province, till they could meet with ſome Biſhop or Lord to entertain them. Being Reduced to ſuch a Condition, how could they purſue their Studies or lead Lives Conformable to their orders. 'Twas only in ſome few Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals and Monaſteries, that a regular Courſe of Studying and the exact Rules of a Religious Life were preſerved and maintained. All this while the Monks <note place="margin">Conc. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisgran. an. 817.</note> and Canons were notoriouſly degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their Primitive Conſtitution, as one may ſee by thoſe excellent Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonnaire</hi> made to reeſtabliſh their Diſcipline. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions following put them into a worſe ſtate than they were in before. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Monaſteries were Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:57456:165"/> Burnt and Ruin'd, by the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> the Monks and Canons Maſſacred or diſperſed and forced to Live in the World again.</p>
               <p>This Ignorance and Poverty to which the Clergy and Monks were reduced, ſo debaſed their Spirits, that they ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inſenſible of the Sufferings of the Church in general, and little minded any thing elſe than how to ſecure their own Stakes, and Live at Eaſe themſelves. Thus Simony came to be a common prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, Concubinage was ſo too, and often maintained with great Impudence; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Germany, where Religion ever had a weak footing. Theſe Ignorant Clerks, who never looked upon their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry as any thing elſe than meerly a Trade to get a Livelihood; who Lived every one by themſelves, without apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Studies or their Prayers, but very much to their ſecular Affairs; did not uuderſtand the reaſons of Celibacy, and looked upon the enjoyning it as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable Tyrany. This was the cauſe of the Rage they expreſſed againſt Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh and all others who were for taking away this occaſion of Offence.</p>
               <p>Under theſe Publick Calamities one may eaſily imagin ho wmiſerably the Poor were neglected. How could they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:57456:165"/> by the Clergy who had ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do to live themſelves? or where could they receive Alms in the times of ſuch dreadful Famines as happened in theſe Ages, where we often read of Mens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to feed on human Fleſh?

The Church found it difficult to perſerve its Conſecrated Plate: 'Tis in theſe times we ſee the Prohibition of the uſe of Calices of Horn, Glaſs, Wood or Copper; and the permiſſion of them of Tin: Not but that the Churches had ſtill vaſt Patrimonies; but that ſerved only as a Bait to the Princes and Lords the more greedily to invade them. The Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks were often uſurped by Perſons alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unqualified, who ſeized them by violence: Many times a Neighbouring Lord would by main force of Arms place a Son of his under Age in the Epiſcopal See, to Plunder the Church under his Name. <hi>Rome</hi> its ſelf was not ſecured from theſe diſorders, the <hi>Petit</hi> Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Tyrants inſulted her moſt; and during the tenth Age we meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but violent Intruſions and Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in this principal See, where till now Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline had been all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long maintained in its Genuine Purity.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:57456:166"/> Councils were very rarely held by reaſon of the difficulty of their meeting, and the univerſal Commotions, which were ſuch that they could not ſafely paſs from one City to another. Thus not only the Diſeaſes of the Church were deſperate, but even the Remedies were hard to come at. The Precedents and Rules of the former Ages were by little and little loſt and forgotten: by ſeeing Crimes paſs unpuniſhed, Men ventured more boldly upon them; and thus they were at firſt accuſtomed to them, and at laſt hardned in them: It was now no longer an ordinary Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per but a plain loſs of Senſe and a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lethargy.</p>
               <p>Every one was a Chriſtian, but in ſuch a manner as if they had thought it a bare priviledge of Nature, and the Chriſtian and the Man had been the ſame thing: There was now no longer a diſtinction. Chriſtianity was little more than a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Country, and ſcarce diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf in any thing elſe than in ſome external Formalities.

How much ſoever ignorance prevailed, yet all the World acknowledged and adored the <hi>one only God,</hi> Creator of the univerſe; and Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour of Mankind: All the World believed a future Judgment and the Life to come; all the great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Morality were every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and acknowledged; whereas in the moſt enlightned times of ancient <hi>Greece</hi> they were always doubted and diſputed even by the Philoſophers themſelves.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, theſe principles were but ill practiced; and though none called the truth of them into Queſtion, yet few pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them to their neceſſary Conſequences, ſo as to lead their Lives in conformity to them: But the Morals of Chriſtianity failed not to produce ſome good effect, even upon thoſe that were no good Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. It prevented a world of miſchief; it ſoftned the moſt Barbarious People, and <note place="margin">

               <p>In theſe times of which I am now ſpeaking, when the Face of the Church appeared ſo disfigured in general, yet there were great Doctors and great Saints of all Conditions in all parts of the Weſt; in <hi>France</hi> the Monaſtick diſcipline began to raiſe up its head by the Foundation of the famous Monaſtery of <hi>Cluny,</hi> whoſe firſt Abbots, St. <hi>Odon</hi> and St. <hi>Majolus</hi> are renowned both for their Life and Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. In <hi>Italy</hi> St. <hi>Romualdus</hi> founded the Monaſtery of <hi>Camaldoli</hi> with many others, and had many eminent Diſciples: We ſee in the ſame times many holy Biſhops of an extraordinary Zeal for Religion, a St. <hi>Dunſtan</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> a St. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dalric</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> a St. <hi>Adelbert</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the <hi>Sclavi</hi> and a Martyr: We ſee St. <hi>Boniface</hi> alſo a Martyr in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> St. <hi>Bruno</hi> in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> St. <hi>Gerard,</hi> a noble <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> Biſhop and Martyr in <hi>Hungary;</hi> and many others who by their Preachings, their Holineſs, and their Miracles conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued down the Tradition of ſound Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:57456:167"/> and Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline. In the ſame Age we have amongſt the Laity ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saints, even of the greateſt Lords, as St. <hi>Gerald</hi> Count of <hi>Aurillac,</hi> St. <hi>Stephen</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and St. <hi>Emeric</hi> his Son, the Emperor St. <hi>Henry,</hi> King <hi>Robert.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe Saints, particularly thoſe of the Nations newly Converted, as St. <hi>Henry</hi> and St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> we may ſee what diſpoſitions towards Vertue were found in thoſe Nations whom the <hi>Romans</hi> called Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. They were naturally great obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of common Equity, generouſly Plain and Open-hearted, Chaſt, Deſpiſers of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and ſenſual ſatisfaction; lovers of Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, Hoſpitality and Alms-giving. When theſe Serious, Sincere, and Couragious People had once made trial of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, they Embraced it heartily. They never ſought after Niceties in the Interpretation of it, nor were they ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered at any of the difficulties it contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: 'Tis true their Conduct was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo conſiſtent and uniform as that of the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> but then they were greater Strangers to Hypocriſy.</p>
               <p>'Twas by the ſpecial Care and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of theſe Holy Perſons, that the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace began to be re-eſtabliſhed by making all the Lords ſwear to the Truce <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Glab. li.</hi> v. <hi>c.</hi> i. <hi>an.</hi> 1041.</note> of God; ſo they called the Ceſſation of all
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:57456:168"/> acts of Hoſtility from <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Night to <hi>Munday</hi> Morning in every Week; and all that time the Clergy, Monks, Pilgrims and Labourers in Husbandry were to be unmoleſted. This Truce was eſtabliſhed <note place="margin">

In theſe times alſo we meet with frequent mention of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt thoſe who ſhould ſtrike a Clergy-man; this was a thing never thought of in the Firſt Ages. Their own Dignity was then thought a ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to them; but they were now every Day expoſed to the utmoſt Violences.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Normans</hi> had deſtroyed a great <note place="margin">L. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Piety and diſcipline.</note> number of Churches, and others were ſuffered to run to Ruin upon the falſe Opinion they had, That the end of the World would be preciſely in the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandth Year of our Lord; but when they <note place="margin">Glab. lib.</note> ſaw that the World ſtill ſtood after that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Year, they began every where to build Churches again; and that after the moſt magnificent manner they were capable of in that Age; always more ſtately than any dwelling Houſes, not only of private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons but of the chiefeſt Nobility: They annexed to them large Endowments,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:57456:168"/> though for the moſt part they were no more than the Reſtitution of Tythes, and the other Gods uſurp'd in the late diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Great care was every where uſed for the recovery of Relicks, and great coſt was ſpent in adorning them with the moſt precious Jewels that could be got, as we may ſtill ſee in the Treaſuries of the moſt ancient Churches. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed themſelves alſo at the ſame time to the reſtoring of the uſe of ſinging in Churches, and the other Solemnities of divine Service: 'Twas in the Eleventh Century that <hi>Guido</hi> Monk of <hi>Arezzo</hi> in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> invented the Notes, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that Method which is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all modern Muſick. The Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Princes I have before mentioned, both by their Liberalities and by their Examples, favoured all theſe good deſigns. Part of the Reſponſes which are now ſung were compoſed by King <hi>Robert,</hi> and he <note place="margin">Helgand. vit. Rob.</note> thought it an honour to perform the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Chanter publickly in the Church.</p>
               <p>I find no Age in which the long <hi>Pſalmody</hi> was more in Vogue, as one may ſee by the Rule of the <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> and the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Baron. ad Martyrol</hi> ii. <hi>Nov.</hi>
                  </note> of thoſe times. The Monks of <hi>Cluny</hi> brought into common uſe the Office for the Dead, and ſoon after commenced the little Office of the Virgin. Many had devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to repeat over every Day the <note place="margin">Petr. Dam. li. 6. ep. 32.</note>
                  <pb n="318" facs="tcp:57456:169"/> whole Book of Pſalms. As the number of their Offices increaſed, ſo did alſo their Maſſes and Altars. Domeſtick Chappels were exceeding numerous, every Lord would have one to himſelf within the Walls of his own Caſtle; that ſo he might not in the War-time be without the Maſs and other Services of the Church; but there was a mixture of Vanity in the Caſe, they loved to have Chaplians in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and diſdained the publick Churches where they were undiſtinguiſhed from the common People. In the mean time it was impoſſible that this multitude of Offices Celebrated in ſo many different places ſhould appear with the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage as it would have done had there been but one Form or Office performed and directed by the Biſhop aſſiſted by all his Clergy; as it was the manner of the Ages foregoing. Beſides, the Reaſon of a great many of the Ceremonies was now forgotten, and yet the Forms were ſtill kept up by Tradition; and the notion of the ancient Politeneſs was quite loſt; ſo that from theſe times we ſee not the ſame care taken as was formerly, to erect their Churches at a convenient diſtance from other common Buildings, and out of the noiſe of publick Places: That they thought in Cities would be to loſe too much Ground. We ſee no more of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:57456:169"/> Door-keepers, or of the other inferiour Orders of Clerks belonging to the Churches, whoſe buſineſs it was to keep every thing Decent, Orderly and Quiet. Theſe Offices were either turned over to Sextons or <hi>Virgers,</hi> and other ſuch-like Servants purely Laicks, or elſe wholly laid aſide; ſo that the Publick Congregations in the Churches became confuſed and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous. The Lords at firſt began the Cuſtom, and from them the Magiſtrates and other Laicks of better Quality took it, to ſeat themſelves in the Choire with the Clergy; and the ancient reſpect being once loſt, the whole crowd of the People, Women and all preſt up to the Altar. <note place="margin">V.

               </p>
               <p>But in the Eleventh Age there were abuſes of far greater importance to be <note place="margin">

Biſhopricks and Benefices were common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought and ſold; and a great part of the Clergy publickly entertained Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines; nay ſome had the Impudence to inſult the Law of the Church that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the <hi>Celibacy</hi> of the Clergy, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt it as an Abuſe. In oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe diſorderly Innovators, St. <hi>Peter Damianus</hi> vigorouſly undertakes the Cauſe, and was ſupported therein by <note place="margin">Patr.

And many others who were content to ſubmit to Penance, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Petr. Dam. opuſc.</hi> vii. <hi>Gomor. cap. 10, 11, 12, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> would do it yet only after ſome Inauthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Canons which very much mitigated the Rigor of it.

                     <hi>Greg.</hi> vii. <hi>lib.</hi> vii. <hi>ep.</hi> x.</note> Relapſes and counterfeit Penances: It is true they reckoned for every Crime a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Penance; ſo that a Man who had committed thirty Homicides, and as many Perjuries or Adulteries, had ſo many Ages of Penance to run through. And from hence came the indulgences of ſo many Years as we meet with in ſome <hi>Bulls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As God demands not impoſſibilities, they who ſtood charged with Penances for their whole Lives, or even beyond
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:57456:170"/> their lives, could do no more than to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy in them the remainder of their days; and to that end for the greater ſecurity, to ſhut themſelves up in a Monaſtery: But ſometimes they were relieved by the Commutation of works of Satisfaction; and theſe were variouſly changed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Abilities or Zeal of the Penitent. St <hi>Peter Damianus</hi> informs us that thoſe <note place="margin">P. Dam. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta SS. Rod. &amp; Domin. c. 8, 10, &amp;c.</note> equivalent Penances were commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his time, and gives us alſo an eſtimate of them. Three thouſand Stripes of Diſcipline could redeem one Year of ordinary Penance; and the ſinging of ten Pſalms, continuing all the while under the Laſh, made a Thouſand Stripes; ſo that the whole Pſaltery made up five years of Penance; and as by vertue of the Communion of Saints, we know God ſometimes pardons Sinners out of regard to the Prayers and other good works of their Brethren; there were ſome holy Perſons in thoſe time who devoted themſelves to the doing of Penance for the ſake of others.</p>
               <p>Of theſe the moſt famous was St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicus Loricatus,</hi> ſo called becauſe he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <note place="margin">Ib. c. 8</note> wore next to his Skin a coat of Mail, which he never put off but when he gave himſelf the diſcipline of the Rod, and that he did ſo often and ſo roughly with ſo many Faſtings, Watchings, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuflexions
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:57456:171"/> and all other ſorts of Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon it, that we are almoſt frightned at the very reading of the account St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Damianus</hi> who was his Spiritual direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor gives us of them: But the niceneſs and Effeminacy of our living way of finds it hard to comply with ſo rigorous a Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of which notwithſtanding we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances in the Saints of thoſe times. But 'tis to be ſuppoſed that God inſpired them with this extraordinary conduct in compaſſion to the neceſſities of that Age: They had to do with a Generation ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and refractory, that 'twas but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſtrike their Senſes with the moſt affecting objects. Bare reaſonings and perſw aſions would have provedbut weak Arguments to ſuch ignorant and brutiſh People, bred up in Blood and Rapine; and moderate ſeverities would have been looked upon as nothing by them who had been from their youth inured to the hardſhips of War, and always walked in Armour: But when they ſaw a St. <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the Diſciple of St. <hi>Romualdus</hi> going bare foot in the coldeſt Countries; a St. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic Loricatus</hi> diſciplining himfelf till he was all of a gore Blood; they could not imagin but that theſe holy Saints did indeed love God and hate Sin; They knew not what to make of mental Prayer, but they very well ſaw that he prayed who repeated
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:57456:171"/> the Pſaltery, and they could not doubt but that theſe holy Perſons loved their Neighbour when they ſaw them doing Penance, even for the Sins of other Men: Convinced by theſe outward and viſible Demonſtrations of their Zeal, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more Docile and Tractable: They willingly hearkned to the Preachings of theſe Prieſts and Monks, whoſe Lives they could not but admire; and many of them were effectually converted: Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed theſe Flagellations, going in Iron-Chains, and ſuch like means of mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fleſh were not new Inventions. <hi>Theodoret</hi> gives us a number of like inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his <hi>Religioſa Hiſtoria,</hi> or the lives of the Religious and Aſceticks; and St. <hi>Simeon Stilites</hi> is alone ſufficient to give Authority to all theſe almoſt incredible Auſterities. The Rule of St. <hi>Columbanus</hi> who lived about the end of the Sixth Age, kept his Monks under the Diſcipline of the Rod, preſcribing for almoſt every fault a certain number of Stripes: And we ſee in the after Ages many Saints giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves voluntary Caſtigations.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Inſtances of diſcipline which ſerved inſtead of Canonical Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, one of the moſt uſual was, That, of taking a Pilgrimage to ſome of the more Celebrated places of Devotion, as to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Tours,</hi> to <hi>Compoſtella.</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:57456:172"/> In the ninth Age the many abuſes which <note place="margin">Conc. Cabil ii. an. 813.</note> had crept into this practice occaſioned great Complaints. If a Prieſt or other Clerk had been guilty of any notorious Crime, 'twas but taking a Pilgrimage; and by that they pretended to wipe off all blots and requalifie themſelves: From hence alſo the Lords took occaſion to lay ſevere Exactions upon their Subjects, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of defraying their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling expences; and many that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their own to live on, under this colour took the advantage of leading Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond lives in Sloth and Beggary: Others there were that paſt all their Days in rov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Capitul. aquiſgran. an. 787. c. 73.</note> about the World, naked and loaded with Chains of Iron, a diſmal Spectacle to all that beheld them. And 'tis true that for Murders and other ſuch-like hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Crimes, the Criminals were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obliged by way of Penance to ſpend their Lives in ſuch a manner, to wander about the World, and carry along with them the marks of their misfortune: But never were Pilgrimages ſo much in vogue as after the end of the Eleventh Age; Wars and publick diſtractions being now in a great meaſure abated, and Pilgrims looked upon as Sacred Perſons; every one was for viſiting the places of Devotion, even Princes and Kings themſelves. King <hi>Robert</hi> paſſed his <note place="margin">Helgaud.</note>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:57456:172"/> Lent in Pilgrimages, and took a Journy to <hi>Rome</hi> for that purpoſe. The Biſhops <note place="margin">Epiſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. vii. ad opiſc. burg.</note> themſelves made no difficulty of being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from their Churches upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>HENCE came the <hi>Croiſades</hi> which <note place="margin">LII. Croiſades and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences.</note> were no other than vaſt Bodies of Armed Pilgrims. Theſe Enterpriſes were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in thoſe times. No one Chriſtian Prince was then of himſelf Potent enough to put a ſtop to the Progreſs of the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> the Declared Enemies of all thoſe who would not embrace their Religion. They had then for Two hundred Years Ravaged <hi>Italy</hi> without Controul; they had made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Sicily</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Spain.</hi> By the help of theſe <hi>Croiſades</hi> they were driven out of all theſe parts of Europe, and had their Power ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much broken in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi> In the mean time among theſe Military Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, the Diſcipline of the Church was but poorly Regarded, and theſe Enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes how Piouſly ſoever deſigned, proved (as far as I can gueſs) one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal cauſes of breaking off the force of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Then it was that firſt came in the Plenary Indulgence, that is to ſay, a total Remiſſion of all Canonical Penalties to any Man, whatſoever that would undertake the Expedition, and liſt himſelf
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:57456:173"/> into the Service of God, for ſo was this <note place="margin">Villehard. lib. i.</note> War called. And this extraordinary Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don drew together vaſt Numbers. Thoſe of the Nobleſs who underſtood nothing but Hunting and Fighting, were very well pleaſed with the Commutation, of having their irkſom Penances of Faſtings and Prayings, and above all the uſe of their Arms and Horſes, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd them during their Penance, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the making of a Campeign. Their Penance was a pleaſure to them; nor was the Fatigue of the March conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable to them who had been always uſed to the Field. New places and new objects were indeed a diverſion to them. There was ſcarce any thing of Trouble in all this, but barely leaving their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and being long abſent from their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. In the mean time great Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Company, was no very proper method for the correcting of Sinners. The Spirit of Compunction could ſcarce ſubſiſt with ſuch a Diſſipation of Thought as their circumſtances neceſſarily inferred. During theſe long Travaels, they could not but be for diverting and entertaining each other with pleaſant Diſcourſes, as the beſt way they had to leſſen the tediouſneſs of their March; and thoſe that are leaſt wife are every where the greateſt Talkers. Their thoughts muſt needs be always in a
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:57456:173"/> hurry about Proviſions, Lodgings, and the ſeveral Adventures they met with; they could not eaſily deny themſelves the Liberty of eating, and Sleeping too much, as thinking ſuch indulgencies in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner neceſſary to refreſh themſelves after their tedious Fatigues. 'Twas impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble under theſe Circumſtances that their Life ſhould be regular or uniform; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the different manners of ſo many Countries they were to Travers in their march to the Holy-Land: The occaſions of Quarrels by reaſon of the diverſity of Humours, Cuſtoms and Languages; the Temptations to Luxury and Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in plentiful Countries, and by the converſation of People extreamly corrupt. So that it plainly appears in Hiſtory, That the Armies of the <hi>Croiſades</hi> were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not better than other Armies, but much worſe. That all ſorts of Vices reigned there; both thoſe which Pilgrims brought from home with them, and thoſe which they found in Strange Countries: In a word, if theſe expeditions ſerv'd for the puniſhment of any Sins, it was not ſo much the Sins of the <hi>Latin</hi> Chriſtians as of the Infidels and Schiſmatick Chriſtans, to whom they were indeed the terrible Scourges of God.</p>
               <p>In theſe Croiſades there were always many Biſhops, Prieſts, and Monks; ſome were put upon by a true Zeal, but Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:57456:174"/> was a Motive to the greateſt part. they thought they might be allowed to bear Arms, and to make uſe of them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Infidels. 'Tis eaſy to imagin what decay in Diſcipline theſe lawleſs courſes joined with the ignorance which had then for ſo long a time prevailed in the World muſt needs have produced. The Popes themſelves, even thoſe that were the beſt meaning among them, found themſelves under a neceſſity of tolerating a great part of theſe Abuſes. They were forced to connive at many particular diſorders to further the grand deſign in general. They were obliged to bare a great regard to the Heads of the Croiſades, ſince by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Arms they ſuccesfully main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Cauſe of the Chriſtian Religion, though they themſelves by their vicious Lives were a Scandal to it. The Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Holy-war was alſo extended to ſuch as ſhould take up Arms againſt the Hereticks, who rebelled not only againſt the Church but againſt their own Princes, as the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> And in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral it was granted in all Wars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Intereſt of Religion was thought to be concerned: And they judged it hard meaſure to deny the ſame favour to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or ſuch other Perſons whoſe Age or Condition put them out of a capacity of bearing Arms; and therefore the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:57456:174"/> was Communicated to them upon their giving Alms toward defraying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the War; nor only ſo, but Alms alſo applyed to other pious Works were likewiſe judged proper to make ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Sins. They gave either Plenary or limited Indulgences to thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed toward the building of Churches: And this ſupplyed the Biſhops with the means of erecting thoſe ſtately Cathedrals ſo much admired at this Day. The ſame favour was granted for building and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing Hoſpitals, eſpecially thoſe two ſorts of them which were very frequent in thoſe Days, <hi>viz.</hi> For <hi>Pilgrims</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> There were alſo in favour of the Poor, indulgences annexed to other works of Charity. Thus Satisfactions became in a manner Arbitrary. The Penetintial Canons being now no longer kept up in practice, the very knowlege of them was ſoon after loſt; and Penance was now made ſo gentle a thing, that Confeſſion was the moſt dreadful part of it.</p>
               <p>IN the Thirteenth Century, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">LIII. The great number of Doctors.</note> Diſcipline received this blow. The Authority of Tradition had carryed it down through the Ages foregoing, and it may be ſaid the Church never was ſo great a ſufferer by ſimple Ignorance, as by new Speculations. They now began
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:57456:175"/> in their Scholaſtick Diſputes to depend too little upon pure Authority and were over fond of working out every thing by their own Reaſonings. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> grew much in faſhion. And the Subtilties of Logick and Metaphyſicks which they borrowed from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> were in mighty requeſt. The ſcarcity of Antient Books, and the difficulty of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by reaſon of the change of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Cuſtomes, Tempted them ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much the more to apply themſelves to Speculations and the Reading of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns. Thus the Scholaſtick Divinity was more valued than the Poſitive; <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> and the Maſter of the Sentences were read more than the Fathers; and in the Scriptures, they were more curious in hunting after a Figurative Senſe then careful to obſerve the Literal.</p>
               <p>After the Twelvth Age the greateſt part of the Biſhops applyed themſelves but little to Preaching, and the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Clergy. They ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be encumbred with Temporal affairs. The Laiety, and eſpecially the Princes being Bred up in Ignorance, knew not how to Manage without the aſſiſtanſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Clergy. 'Twas out of the Biſhops and Abbots that they choſe their Chancellours and Miniſters of State. They were made Judges in almoſt all
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:57456:175"/> Cauſes. Without going any farther, their Temporal Lordſhips found them work enough; the Wars in which they were often forced to engage, the fortifying their Garriſons and aſſembling their Troops. They were obliged to maintain grand Equipages, large Families, and all ſort of Officers. In the midſt of ſo much buſineſs, the Spiritual part, which ought to have been the chieſeſt, was too often neglected. Thus Studying, Preaching, and the Adminiſtring the Sacraments fell to the Lot of the Doctors, of whom the Univerſities were full, but chiefly into the Hands of the Religious Mendicants, who came in very ſeaſonably to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Church in theſe unhappy Ages.</p>
               <p>But theſe Religious, how holy and how Zealous ſoever they might be, were not Proper Paſtors over any certain people, nor had they any regular Juriſdiction. They were rather a ſort of <hi>Miſſionaries;</hi> who following the orders of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, travelled throughout all the Dioceſes, Labouring in the Converſion of Hereticks and Sinners. Nor were their Labours without Succeſs. But the good ſervices they did the Church took not their full effect for want of power to continue their farther Inſtructions to thoſe whom they had converted, to correct their Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and compleat their Work, by
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:57456:176"/> abiding with them and watching over them till they had eſtabliſhed them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond relapſe in the Right way. All this they could do only to ſome particular Perſons, who voluntarily Reſigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their Direction. So that the Fruits of their Labours could not be of ſo general Effect, as when every Biſhop cloſely applyed himſelf to the Edification of his own Flock.</p>
               <p>The Caſe was much the ſame with them in reſpect of Studies. The Doctors whether Seculars or Regulars that were in poſſeſſion of the Chairs, had ſcarce any thing of Authority, beſides what their perſonal Merit procured them. It was free for the Students to follow what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they liked beſt. And from hence aroſe that Diverſity of Sects and Opinions, concerning matters that were allowed to be diſputed. For as there were a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Doctors who were not employed in the Cure of Souls, but ſpent their whole time in the Schools; they had lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to treat of many Queſtions more <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thomaſs. diſcipl.</hi> iv. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 69. <hi>n.</hi> xi.</note> Curious then uſeful. The Laicks alſo were left at their own Liberty to follow what Preachers they moſt Affected, and to chuſe to themſelves their own Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, beſides their proper Paſtors. So that among ſuch a mnltitude of Prieſts, bad Chriſtians could not fail of meeting
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:57456:176"/> with ſome or other who would give them Abſolution upon very eaſy Terms: And thus ſuch as were willing to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived themſelves, or had a mind to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others did not forbear, without mending their Manners, to frequent the Churches and come to the Sacraments.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the Doctors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were born down by the Stream of the Corruption of the People, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many conſiderable Relaxations of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to plead Preſcription. The little knowledge they had of the ancient Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Church, was the principal cauſe of this Miſchief. The uſages intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced an Age or two before went down with them for immemorial Cuſtoms: It is ſtrange, for inſtance, that in the Days of St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> they ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how they kept their Faſts in the <note place="margin">S. Bern. Serm. in cap. Jejun.</note> Age preceeding; For St. <hi>Bernard</hi> aſſures us that in his time all the World without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, obſerved in Lent not to break their Faſt till Evening. Kings and Princes, Clergy, People, gentle and Simple, Rich and Poor, all of them did ſo; and yet St. <hi>Thomas</hi> not only plainly tells us that in his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>S. Thom.</hi> ii. ix. 147. <hi>art. 7. ad</hi> i.</note> time none Faſted beyond three of the Clock in the Afternoon, but alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to prove, That Chriſtians ought not to Faſt after any other manner; and that Faſting till the Evening was peculiar
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:57456:177"/> to the old Law: So eaſy a thing is it to find arguments to juſtify all ſorts of Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices when one is ignorant of Fact. This Ignorance made them look upon Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity as Novelty, and the Authority of the Moderns as a ſurer Ground to proceed upon than that of the Antients, of whom they had only a confuſed notion, that their Manners were altogether different from ours, without ſufficiently diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing whether this diverſity lay in any of the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, or only in ſuch indifferent matters as Habits and Language. And as they gave themſelves the liberty of ſtarting every Day new Queſtions and inventing new Subtilies; there aroſe at laſt a ſet of Caſuiſts who founded their Morals rather upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Reaſon, than upon Scripture and Tradition, as if Jeſus Chriſt had not taught us all Truth, as well for Manners as for Faith; but had left us ſtill to ſeek with the ancient Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>I SHALL not pretend to give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <note place="margin">LIV. A ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of found Doctrin and good examples in all times.</note> of the diſorders that followed upon theſe looſe Principles which they brought into their new Syſtem of Morality; they are but too well known of themſelves: Nor is it my deſign to deſcribe the manners of bad Chriſtians, which are no better than thoſe of other Men; my buſineſs is only
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:57456:177"/> to repreſent the manners which diſtinguiſh true Chriſtians from the reſt of the World. Now God hath never ſo forſaken his Church, but examples of this kind were always to be found in it: After what manner ſoever the Church was governed whether immediately by Biſhops, or by Prieſts, either Commiſſionated by them, or ſent abroad by the Popes, whether by Seculars or Regulars, by ordinary Paſtors or Foreign Miſſionaries; it hath always had the ſame Religion and the ſame Body of Doctrine. The true Faith has always been preſerved in purity, and the grand principles of Morality have always ſtood firm. It hath been always a thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and granted that we ought to obſerve the Law of God explained according to Tradition, and the Authority of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; and that we ought to form our Lives after the examples of thoſe holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whom the Church hath publickly Honoured for Saints.</p>
               <p>And ſuch living Models there have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been; every Age hath had its Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <note place="margin">Serm. de S. Andr. vit. S. Mala.</note> that went to Preach the Faith to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels; every Age hath had its Martyrs; Virgins and true Penitents have always been in great numbers: It was (as St. <hi>Bernard</hi> obſerves) the ſincere deſire of Penitence that after the Eleventh Age in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced ſomany new Orders of Monks.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:57456:178"/> God hath always from time to time raiſed up extraordinary Perſons to maintain his holy Doctrine and revive decaying Piety. What is there comparable to St. <hi>Bernard?</hi> Hath he not ſhewn in his own Perſon the Zeal of the Prophets, the Learning and Eloquence of the greateſt Doctors of the Church, and the Mortification of the moſt perfect Recluſes? We are certainly much endebted to <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, and the other great and learned Popes of thoſe times, to the <hi>Maſter</hi> of the Sentences and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> and the reſt of them who have reduced Divinity into a Method. St. <hi>Francis</hi> hath given us an eminent Example of the Chriſtian Life, practiced according to the Letter, of an Humility and Mortification worthy of the Apoſtolick Time: Thus from Age to Age, from Generation to Generation, God hath preſerved in his Church the ſucceſſion of true Doctrine and Holy Life.</p>
               <p>It is certain then, That Jeſus Chriſt is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 8.</note> to Day as well as Yeſterday, and will be the ſame to all Ages. In vain therefore do bad Chriſtians now adays vilify the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration we juſtly have for Antiquity, and for the Examples of the Saints; by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that in the Firſt Ages of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Men were clear of another Nature then what we are now; their Bodies ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſt and better able to bare thoſe Faſtings
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:57456:178"/> and other ſuch-like Severities; their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits more Docile and pliable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the practices of Vertue more eaſy to them: If we tell them that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> lived in Poverty and Labour; <note place="margin">V. Chryſoſt de com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punct.</note> they Anſwer, <hi>They were Apoſtles;</hi> St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> and St. <hi>Martin</hi> underwent great Mortifications; <hi>They were Saints:</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> made his Clergy live in Common; and he himſelf (tho' a great Biſhop) liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but very Ordinarily; <hi>This might be in thoſe Days:</hi> Do you think therefore that theſe Words, <hi>Saintſhip, Antiquity,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> are allowable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions? That the exerciſes of Penance; the being continually occupied in the word of God; the renouncing the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Vanities of this wicked World; the Clergies keeping themſelves diſengag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Secular Affairs, and leading lives ſingularly Exemplary: That all theſe things were the extraordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of the Primitive Church, whoſe excellencies we muſt not pretend to Rival<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> That to exempt our ſelves from the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of following ſo glorious Preſidents, 'tis but to diſtinguiſh the Times and the Work's done.</p>
               <p>The Church (ſay they) was ſtrong and vigorous in her Youth, and produced then Heroick Vertues: She is now in her Old Age and Declenſion; ſhe hath had
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:57456:179"/> her <hi>Spring</hi> and her <hi>Summer;</hi> and now ſhe is in her <hi>Winter:</hi> But what mean theſe <hi>Metaphors?</hi> Do they pretend that the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Church doth in reality re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Changes of the Year, or the courſe of the Life of Man? will any one dare to ſay, that ſhe was imperfect in her beginnings, wanted time to give her full Maturity, and muſt feel her decays; as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tranſitory things, or like the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men. But I deſire to know in what this change has happened ſince the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Goſpel; <hi>Is it in humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> Experience and the Faith of all Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory aſſures us the contrary: <hi>Is it in the Law of God, or is it in his Grace?</hi> Herein there is ſtill the ſame Power, the ſame Goodneſs that ever there was. Jeſus Chriſt hath never told us that his Church muſt be governed by different Rules ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the changes of Times. The Abolition of the ancient Law and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogation of Ceremonies was expreſly foretold: but as to the Goſpel it muſt be Preached both to the utmoſt parts of the Earth, and to the end of the World: Let us not therefore deceive our ſelves with frivolous excuſes, nor charge the preſent corruption of our Manners upon any other fault then that of our Ignorance and Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence. <note place="margin">Apolog. decretor.</note>

                  <hi>Manners and Diſcipline of the ancient Church as to attack its Faith, ſince both the one and the other are derived to us from the ſame Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is true, the Church hath ſometimes borh with ſome Abuſes which had taken <note place="margin">LV. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in the Church and how they came to be ſo.</note> too deep rooting, waiting a favourable Conjuncture to Reform them; and hath ſometimes indulged her Children for the hardneſs of their Hearts in the Relaxation of the ancient Diſcipline. The Rule of Communicating four times a Year ſtood in force in the Ninth Age; but in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it was only ill obſerved. <hi>Petrus Bleſenſis</hi> informs us, that in his times in the <note place="margin">Petr. Bleſ. Serm. 16.</note> Twelfth Age, the greateſt part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Communicated but once a Year: The Church complied with this uſage and put it in the Canons of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. It was forbidden formerly to ſay <note place="margin">

In the time of St. <hi>Thomas;</hi> that is a bout Four hundred Years ago, they kept their Faſts till three of the Clock in the Afternoon; and we find no mention but of one eating; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it came to Noon, and a Collation was allowed: Amongſt theſe Mitigations I reckon Penance left to the diſcretion of the Confeſſor, and the frequent granting of Indulgencies; as likewiſe the diſpenſing
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:57456:180"/> with the Rigor of many of the Rules of the Monaſticks. They thought that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, though falling ſhort of the utmoſt Perfection that their Rule required, would yet even under ſome abatements arrive to an higher Perfection than if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the World, and that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſomewhat to ſoften and qualify the Faſt of Lent, than to let it run wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſuſe; but we are not from thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſions to imagine that the way to Heaven is become more eaſy to Us, than it was to them of Old; that we are more happy than our Fore-fathers; or that the Biſhops and Popes of theſe laſt Ages thought themſelves wiſer than their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors.</p>
               <p>We need only read the Conſtitutions and Canons which have Authoriſed the ſeveral Relaxations, to ſee that the Church never did it without Regret. Many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viations came in only by common uſage. In the mean time the Church hath taken ſpecial care in ſuch caſes, to retain cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Obſervances in remembrance of the true Practice of Antiquity. Thus the Office for the Noon or Evening Service ſaid on Faſt-days before Dinner; All the Formularies of Ordinations and other publick Acts, are as it were ſo many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Proteſtations to ſalve the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:57456:180"/> of the ancient Rules, and bar the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Preſcription againſt them.</p>
               <p>There are other Abuſes which the Church hath always condemned; as thoſe abſurd Shows which they had the boldneſs to bring even into the Churches themſelves, and which were forbidden in the Council of <hi>Baſil:</hi> And as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Conc. Baſil. Seſs.</hi> xii. <hi>c.</hi> xi. <hi>V. Syn.

Little did the Apoſtles and their Diſciples imagine that this Holy Preparation for the Paſſover, ſhould one Day have proved an occaſion of Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Licentiouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The Saints and all true Chriſtians have always openly declared againſt theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes. We know with what Vigour St. <hi>Charles Borromeus</hi> ſuppreſſed them, and how Zealouſly he Laboured to bring back again into the Church the Spirit of Antiquity, even to the leſſer matters of Religion. The Council of Trent, and thoſe who were employed to ſee it put into Execution in the Provinces, aimed
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:57456:181"/> at no other end than This. And ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Reformations that have been made in the Religious Orders ſince the laſt Age, were only in order to reduce them to their Primitive Conſtitution.

               <p>Proceeding upon ſo good Authorities, <note place="margin">LVI. The uſe of this Work.</note> I thought I might do ſome ſervice to the World in Repreſenting the Manners of the Ancients, which ought to be the Patterns now of all good Chriſtians. I have ſaid nothing but what is well known to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Learning, and taken out of Books with which they are familiarly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And they will ſee that much more might have been added to the ſame Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. There are many things here not commonly known to every good Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian; and ſuch things too as are fit for their Edification. They will ſee that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:57456:181"/> the Religion of a Chriſtian conſiſts not altogether (as too many imagine) in ſome formal performances. To ſay over every Morning and Night ſome ſhort Prayers; to aſſiſt on Sundays at the Publick Service; to diſtinguiſh the Holy Time of Lent, only by abſtaining from ſome certain ſort of Dyets, and to diſpence with it upon trivial Occaſions; to approach the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo Seldom, and with ſo ſmall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that they turn Solemn Feſtivals into Melancholy Days. And as to the common Courſe of their Lives, to be as much addicted to the Intereſts and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this World as <hi>Pagans</hi> themſelves could be. Theſe are not the Chriſtians I have been Deſcribing.</p>
               <p>I hope alſo, that the Deſcription I have here given of the Holy Manners of thoſe that were really Chriſtians, may make ſome Impreſſions upon ſuch Perſons who have no more ſenſe of things, than to confound the true Religion with thoſe falſe ones which the Error of Ignorant, or Craft of diſigning Men have introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Let a Man but conſider that vaſt change of Manners which the Goſpel hath wrought in all Nations, and the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Characters there have always been between true Chriſtians, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels; and he will ſee that the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſtands upon a ſurer Bottom then he
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:57456:182"/> thought for. He will be forced to believe that it was at firſt eſtabliſhed by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Miracles, for there can be nothing more Incredible than that ſuch a Change ſhould be wrought without Miracles. Theſe Miracles made ſo ſtrong an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that it was not till very late any one did ſo much as think of calling them into Queſtion. To ſpeak no more than what we know, 'tis ſcarce above Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years ſince this Libertiniſm was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by ſome <hi>Italians,</hi> who tho' Men of Wit, were very Ignorant of Religion, and diſguſted with theſe Abuſes; then they were charmed with the Beauty of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Greek and Latin Authors, with the Government of theſe People and their way of Living: And ſo much the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the maxims of thoſe Heathens bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agreed with the Corruption of human Nature, and the general Practices of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. In ſhort theſe Modern <hi>Italians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed nothing elſe.</p>
               <p>This miſchief was farther encreaſed by the new Hereſies that were broached in theſe laſt Ages. The Diſputes upon the very Fundamental Principles of Religion ſhock't the Faith of many; who yet upon divers Temporal Motives continued in the outward profeſſion of the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: And amongſt the Hereticks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were great numbers who being no
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:57456:182"/> longer reſtrained by Authority, have driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Conſequences of their ill principles to extremity, and are come to that paſs as to look upon Religion it ſelf as no more than a piece of State-Policy. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy notion got ground, and eaſily ſpread it ſelf. Young Perſons hearing their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents perhaps, or thoſe whom they looked upon as Men of Wit, making ſome lewd Jeſts upon Religion, or it may be ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſay in plain terms, that there was nothing in it at the bottom, preſently took up with that; and finding theſe notions agreeable to their Paſſions and Deſires, never troubled their thoughts any farther about inquiring into the Merit of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Vanity alſo came in for its ſhare: They thought by this means to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the ignorant Vulgar, and appear more diſcerning than the honeſt well meaning People of former Ages: beſides ſloth was another Motive to make them either take matters upon truſt, or determine at all Adventures rather than to be at the trouble of examining the Truth; but let Men ſay what they will, the matters I have here laid down will be always true; what <hi>Origen</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Celſus</hi> ſo often inculcates, that Jeſus Chriſt hath reformed the World, and filled it with vertues unknown to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages.</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:57456:183"/>
               <p>And this is what I had to ſay concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Manners of the Iſraelites and of <note place="margin">LVII. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> the Chriſtians; ſuch was the outward appearance of the Lives of the faithful of the Old and of the New-Teſtament. In my Opinion the firſt Diſcourſe ſhews us <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Iſraelites, publiſhed alſo in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh 1683. but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any notice of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</hi>
                  </note> the beſt uſe of Temporal advantages, and the moſt accountable Methods of living up to Innocence and Nature. In this <hi>latter</hi> I have endeavoured to ſhew what was the life of thoſe whoſe Converſation was in Heaven; and who while they were in the Fleſh lived yet by the Spirit. This Life perfectly Spiritual and Supernatural was the peculiar effect of the Grace of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If what I have Written proves Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to give a right notion of the Life which is truly reaſonable and Chriſtian, and to make any one apply himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to the practice of it: If matters prove thus, I ſhall not at all be diſturbed at the different Cenſures of the Reader, or the Faults with which the Work may be Charged.</p>
